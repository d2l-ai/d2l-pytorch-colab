    "In :numref:`sec_seq2seq`, we encode the source sequence input information in the recurrent unit state and then pass it to the decoder to generate the target sequence. A token in the target sequence may closely relate to one or more tokens in the source sequence, instead of the whole source sequence. For example, when translating \"Hello world.\" to \"Bonjour le monde.\", \"Bonjour\" maps to \"Hello\" and \"monde\" maps to \"world\". In the seq2seq model, the decoder may implicitly select the corresponding information from the state passed by the encoder. The attention mechanism, however, makes this selection explicit.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Attention* is a generalized pooling method with bias alignment over inputs. The core component in the attention mechanism is the attention layer, or called *attention* for simplicity. An input of the attention layer is called a *query*. For a query, attention returns an output based on the memory---a set of key-value pairs encoded in the attention layer. To be more specific, assume that the memory contains $n$ key-value pairs, $(\\mathbf{k}_1, \\mathbf{v}_1), \\ldots, (\\mathbf{k}_n, \\mathbf{v}_n)$, with $\\mathbf{k}_i \\in \\mathbb R^{d_k}$, $\\mathbf{v}_i \\in \\mathbb R^{d_v}$. Given a query $\\mathbf{q} \\in \\mathbb R^{d_q}$, the attention layer returns an output $\\mathbf{o} \\in \\mathbb R^{d_v}$ with the same shape as the value.\n",
