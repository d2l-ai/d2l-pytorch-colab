    "# Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)\n",
    ":label:`sec_bert`\n",
    "\n",
    "We have introduced several word embedding models for natural language understanding.\n",
    "After pretraining, the output can be thought of as a matrix\n",
    "where each row is a vector that represents a word of a predefined vocabulary.\n",
    "In fact, these word embedding models are all *context-independent*.\n",
    "Let's begin by illustrating this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Context-Independent to Context-Sensitive\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the experiments in :numref:`sec_word2vec_pretraining` and :numref:`sec_synonyms`.\n",
    "For instance, word2vec and GloVe both assign the same pretrained vector to the same word regardless of the context of the word (if any).\n",
    "Formally, a context-independent representation of any token $x$\n",
    "is a function $f(x)$ that only takes $x$ as its input.\n",
    "Given the abundance of polysemy and complex semantics in natural languages,\n",
    "context-independent representations have obvious limitations.\n",
    "For instance, the word \"crane\" in contexts\n",
    "\"a crane is flying\" and \"a crane driver came\" has completely different meanings;\n",
    "thus, the same word may be assigned different representations depending on contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivates the development of *context-sensitive* word representations,\n",
    "where representations of words depend on their contexts.\n",
    "Hence, a context-sensitive representation of token $x$ is a function $f(x, c(x))$\n",
    "depending on both $x$ and its context $c(x)$.\n",
    "Popular context-sensitive representations\n",
    "include TagLM (language-model-augmented sequence tagger) :cite:`Peters.Ammar.Bhagavatula.ea.2017`,\n",
    "CoVe (Context Vectors) :cite:`McCann.Bradbury.Xiong.ea.2017`,\n",
    "and ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) :cite:`Peters.Neumann.Iyyer.ea.2018`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, by taking the entire sequence as input,\n",
    "ELMo is a function that assigns a representation to each word from the input sequence.\n",
    "Specifically, ELMo combines all the intermediate layer representations from pretrained bidirectional LSTM as the output representation.\n",
    "Then the ELMo representation will be added to a downstream task's existing supervised model\n",
    "as additional features, such as by concatenating ELMo representation and the original representation (e.g., GloVe) of tokens in the existing model.\n",
    "On the one hand,\n",
    "all the weights in the pretrained bidirectional LSTM model are frozen after ELMo representations are added.\n",
    "On the other hand,\n",
    "the existing supervised model is specifically customized for a given task.\n",
    "Leveraging different best models for different tasks at that time,\n",
    "adding ELMo improved the state of the art across six natural language processing tasks:\n",
    "sentiment analysis, natural language inference,\n",
    "semantic role labeling, coreference resolution,\n",
    "named entity recognition, and question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Task-Specific to Task-Agnostic\n",
    "\n",
    "Although ELMo has significantly improved solutions to a diverse set of natural language processing tasks,\n",
    "each solution still hinges on a *task-specific* architecture.\n",
    "However, it is practically non-trivial to craft a specific architecture for every natural language processing task.\n",
    "The GPT (Generative Pre-Training) model represents an effort in designing\n",
    "a general *task-agnostic* model for context-sensitive representations :cite:`Radford.Narasimhan.Salimans.ea.2018`.\n",
    "Built on a Transformer decoder,\n",
    "GPT pretrains a language model that will be used to represent text sequences.\n",
    "When applying GPT to a downstream task,\n",
    "the output of the language model will be fed into an added linear output layer\n",
    "to predict the label of the task.\n",
    "In sharp contrast to ELMo that freezes parameters of the pretrained model,\n",
    "GPT fine-tunes *all* the parameters in the pretrained Transformer decoder\n",
    "during supervised learning of the downstream task.\n",
    "GPT was evaluated on twelve tasks of natural language inference,\n",
    "question answering, sentence similarity, and classification,\n",
    "and improved the state of the art in nine of them with minimal changes\n",
    "to the model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to the autoregressive nature of language models,\n",
    "GPT only looks forward (left-to-right).\n",
    "In contexts \"i went to the bank to deposit cash\" and \"i went to the bank to sit down\",\n",
    "as \"bank\" is sensitive to the context to its left,\n",
    "GPT will return the same representation for \"bank\",\n",
    "though it has different meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## BERT: Combining the Best of Both Worlds\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen,\n",
    "ELMo encodes context bidirectionally but uses task-specific architectures;\n",
    "while GPT is task-agnostic but encodes context left-to-right.\n",
    "Combining the best of both worlds,\n",
    "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\n",
    "encodes context bidirectionally and requires minimal architecture changes\n",
    "for a wide range of natural language processing tasks :cite:`Devlin.Chang.Lee.ea.2018`.\n",
    "Using a pretrained Transformer encoder,\n",
    "BERT is able to represent any token based on its bidirectional context.\n",
    "During supervised learning of downstream tasks,\n",
    "BERT is similar to GPT in two aspects.\n",
    "First, BERT representations will be fed into an added output layer,\n",
    "with minimal changes to the model architecture depending on nature of tasks,\n",
    "such as predicting for every token vs. predicting for the entire sequence.\n",
    "Second,\n",
    "all the parameters of the pretrained Transformer encoder are fine-tuned,\n",
    "while the additional output layer will be trained from scratch.\n",
    ":numref:`fig_elmo-gpt-bert` depicts the differences among ELMo, GPT, and BERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A comparison of ELMo, GPT, and BERT.](../img/elmo-gpt-bert.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_elmo-gpt-bert`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT further improved the state of the art on eleven natural language processing tasks\n",
    "under broad categories of (i) single text classification (e.g., sentiment analysis), (ii) text pair classification (e.g., natural language inference),\n",
    "(iii) question answering, (iv) text tagging (e.g., named entity recognition).\n",
    "All proposed in 2018,\n",
    "from context-sensitive ELMo to task-agnostic GPT and BERT,\n",
    "conceptually simple yet empirically powerful pretraining of deep representations for natural languages have revolutionized solutions to various natural language processing tasks.\n",

    "* Word embedding models such as word2vec and GloVe are context-independent. They assign the same pretrained vector to the same word regardless of the context of the word (if any). It is hard for them to handle well polysemy or complex semantics in natural languages.\n",
    "* For context-sensitive word representations such as ELMo and GPT, representations of words depend on their contexts.\n",
    "* ELMo encodes context bidirectionally but uses task-specific architectures (however, it is practically non-trivial to craft a specific architecture for every natural language processing task); while GPT is task-agnostic but encodes context left-to-right.\n",
    "* BERT combines the best of both worlds: it encodes context bidirectionally and requires minimal architecture changes for a wide range of natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "* The embeddings of the BERT input sequence are the sum of the token embeddings, segment embeddings, and positional embeddings.\n",
    "* Pretraining BERT is composed of two tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. The former is able to encode bidirectional context for representing words, while the latter explicitly models the logical relationship between text pairs.\n",

    "1. In the original implementation of BERT, the positionwise feed-forward network in `BERTEncoder` (via `d2l.TransformerEncoderBlock`) and the fully connected layer in `MaskLM` both use the Gaussian error linear unit (GELU) :cite:`Hendrycks.Gimpel.2016` as the activation function.
