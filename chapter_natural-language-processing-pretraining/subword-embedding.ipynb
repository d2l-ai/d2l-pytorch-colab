    "# Subword Embedding\n",
    ":label:`sec_fasttext`\n",
    "\n",
    "In English,\n",
    "words such as\n",
    "\"helps\", \"helped\", and \"helping\" are \n",
    "inflected forms of the same word \"help\".\n",
    "The relationship \n",
    "between \"dog\" and \"dogs\"\n",
    "is the same as \n",
    "that between \"cat\" and \"cats\",\n",
    "and \n",
    "the relationship \n",
    "between \"boy\" and \"boyfriend\"\n",
    "is the same as \n",
    "that between \"girl\" and \"girlfriend\".\n",
    "In other languages\n",
    "such as French and Spanish,\n",
    "many verbs have over 40 inflected forms,\n",
    "while in Finnish,\n",
    "a noun may have up to 15 cases.\n",
    "In linguistics,\n",
    "morphology studies word formation and word relationships.\n",
    "However,\n",
    "the internal structure of words\n",
    "was neither explored in word2vec\n",
    "nor in GloVe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The fastText Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall how words are represented in word2vec.\n",
    "In both the skip-gram model\n",
    "and the continuous bag-of-words model,\n",
    "different inflected forms of the same word\n",
    "are directly represented by different vectors\n",
    "without shared parameters.\n",
    "To use morphological information,\n",
    "the *fastText* model\n",
    "proposed a *subword embedding* approach,\n",
    "where a subword is a character $n$-gram :cite:`Bojanowski.Grave.Joulin.ea.2017`.\n",
    "Instead of learning word-level vector representations,\n",
    "fastText can be considered as\n",
    "the subword-level skip-gram,\n",
    "where each *center word* is represented by the sum of \n",
    "its subword vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate how to obtain \n",
    "subwords for each center word in fastText\n",
    "using the word \"where\".\n",
    "First, add special characters “&lt;” and “&gt;” \n",
    "at the beginning and end of the word to distinguish prefixes and suffixes from other subwords. \n",
    "Then, extract character $n$-grams from the word.\n",
    "For example, when $n=3$,\n",
    "we obtain all subwords of length 3: \"&lt;wh\", \"whe\", \"her\", \"ere\", \"re&gt;\", and the special subword \"&lt;where&gt;\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In fastText, for any word $w$,\n",
    "denote by $\\mathcal{G}_w$\n",
    "the union of all its subwords of length between 3 and 6\n",
    "and its special subword.\n",
    "The vocabulary \n",
    "is the union of the subwords of all words.\n",
    "Letting $\\mathbf{z}_g$\n",
    "be the vector of subword $g$ in the dictionary,\n",
    "the vector $\\mathbf{v}_w$ for \n",
    "word $w$ as a center word\n",
    "in the skip-gram model\n",
    "is the sum of its subword vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{v}_w = \\sum_{g\\in\\mathcal{G}_w} \\mathbf{z}_g.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of fastText is the same as the skip-gram model. Compared with the skip-gram model, \n",
    "the vocabulary in fastText is larger,\n",
    "resulting in more model parameters. \n",
    "Besides, \n",
    "to calculate the representation of a word,\n",
    "all its subword vectors\n",
    "have to be summed,\n",
    "leading to higher computational complexity.\n",
    "However,\n",
    "thanks to shared parameters from subwords among words with similar structures,\n",
    "rare words and even out-of-vocabulary words\n",
    "may obtain better vector representations in fastText.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Byte Pair Encoding\n",
    ":label:`subsec_Byte_Pair_Encoding`\n",
    "\n",
    "In fastText, all the extracted subwords have to be of the specified lengths, such as $3$ to $6$, thus the vocabulary size cannot be predefined.\n",
    "To allow for variable-length subwords in a fixed-size vocabulary,\n",
    "we can apply a compression algorithm\n",
    "called *byte pair encoding* (BPE) to extract subwords :cite:`Sennrich.Haddow.Birch.2015`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Byte pair encoding performs a statistical analysis of the training dataset to discover common symbols within a word,\n",
    "such as consecutive characters of arbitrary length.\n",
    "Starting from symbols of length 1,\n",
    "byte pair encoding iteratively merges the most frequent pair of consecutive symbols to produce new longer symbols.\n",
    "Note that for efficiency, pairs crossing word boundaries are not considered.\n",
    "In the end, we can use such symbols as subwords to segment words.\n",
    "Byte pair encoding and its variants has been used for input representations in popular natural language processing pretraining models such as GPT-2 :cite:`Radford.Wu.Child.ea.2019` and RoBERTa :cite:`Liu.Ott.Goyal.ea.2019`.\n",
    "In the following, we will illustrate how byte pair encoding works.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we initialize the vocabulary of symbols as all the English lowercase characters, a special end-of-word symbol `'_'`, and a special unknown symbol `'[UNK]'`.\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* The fastText model proposes a subword embedding approach. Based on the skip-gram model in word2vec, it represents a center word as the sum of its subword vectors.\n",
    "* Byte pair encoding performs a statistical analysis of the training dataset to discover common symbols within a word. As a greedy approach, byte pair encoding iteratively merges the most frequent pair of consecutive symbols.\n",
    "* Subword embedding may improve the quality of representations of rare words and out-of-dictionary words.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As an example, there are about $3\\times 10^8$ possible  $6$-grams in English. What is the issue when there are too many subwords? How to address the issue? Hint: refer to the end of Section 3.2 of the fastText paper :cite:`Bojanowski.Grave.Joulin.ea.2017`.\n",
    "1. How to design a subword embedding model based on the continuous bag-of-words model?\n",
    "1. To get a vocabulary of size $m$, how many merging operations are needed when the initial symbol vocabulary size is $n$?\n",
    "1. How to extend the idea of byte pair encoding to extract phrases?\n"
