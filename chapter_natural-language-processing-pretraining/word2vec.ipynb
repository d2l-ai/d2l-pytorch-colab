    "\n",
    "Natural language is a complex system used to express meanings.\n",
    "In this system, words are the basic unit of the meaning.\n",
    "As the name implies,\n",
    "*word vectors* are vectors used to represent words,\n",
    "and can also be considered as feature vectors or representations of words.\n",
    "The technique of mapping words to real vectors\n",
    "is called *word embedding*.\n",
    "In recent years,\n",
    "word embedding has gradually become\n",
    "the basic knowledge of natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-Hot Vectors Are a Bad Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "We used one-hot vectors to represent words (characters are words) in :numref:`sec_rnn-scratch`.\n",
    "Suppose that the number of different words in the dictionary (the dictionary size) is $N$,\n",
    "and each word corresponds to\n",
    "a different integer (index) from $0$ to $N-1$.\n",
    "To obtain the one-hot vector representation\n",
    "for any word with index $i$,\n",
    "we create a length-$N$ vector with all 0s\n",
    "and set the element at position $i$ to 1.\n",
    "In this way, each word is represented as a vector of length $N$, and it\n",
    "can be used directly by neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although one-hot word vectors are easy to construct,\n",
    "they are usually not a good choice.\n",
    "A main reason is that one-hot word vectors cannot accurately express the similarity between different words, such as the *cosine similarity* that we often use.\n",
    "For vectors $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, their cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{y}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| \\|\\mathbf{y}\\|} \\in [-1, 1].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the cosine similarity between one-hot vectors of any two different words is 0,\n",
    "one-hot vectors cannot encode similarities among words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Self-Supervised word2vec\n",
    "\n",
    "The [word2vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) tool was proposed to address the above issue.\n",
    "It maps each word to a fixed-length vector, and  these vectors can better express the similarity and analogy relationship among different words.\n",
    "The word2vec tool contains two models, namely *skip-gram* :cite:`Mikolov.Sutskever.Chen.ea.2013`  and *continuous bag of words* (CBOW) :cite:`Mikolov.Chen.Corrado.ea.2013`.\n",
    "For semantically meaningful representations,\n",
    "their training relies on\n",
    "conditional probabilities\n",
    "that can be viewed as predicting\n",
    "some words using some of their surrounding words\n",
    "in corpora.\n",
    "Since supervision comes from the data without labels,\n",
    "both skip-gram and continuous bag of words\n",
    "are self-supervised models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will introduce these two models and their training methods.\n",
