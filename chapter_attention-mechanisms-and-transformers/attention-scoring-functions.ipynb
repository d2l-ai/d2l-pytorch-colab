    "## [**Dot Product Attention**]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review the attention function (without exponentiation) from the Gaussian kernel for a moment:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "a(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}_i) & = -\\frac{1}{2} \\|\\mathbf{q} - \\mathbf{k}_i\\|^2  \\\\\n",
    "& = \\mathbf{q}^\\top \\mathbf{k}_i -\\frac{1}{2} \\|\\mathbf{k}_i\\|^2  -\\frac{1}{2} \\|\\mathbf{q}\\|^2.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that the last term depends on $\\mathbf{q}$ only. As such it is identical for all $(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}_i)$ pairs. Normalizing the attention weights to $1$, as is done in :eqref:`eq_softmax_attention`, ensures that this term disappears entirely. Second, note that both batch and layer normalization (to be discussed later) lead to activations that have well-bounded, and often constant norms $\\|\\mathbf{k}_i\\| \\approx \\mathrm{const}$. This is the case, for instance, whenever the keys $\\mathbf{k}_i$ were generated by a layer norm. As such, we can drop it from the definition of $a$ without any major change in the outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Last, we need to keep the order of magnitude of the arguments in the exponential function under control. Assume that all the elements of the query $\\mathbf{q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and the key $\\mathbf{k}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ are independent and identically drawn random variables with zero mean and unit variance. The dot product between both vectors has zero mean and a variance of $d$. To ensure that the variance of the dot product still remains one regardless of vector length, we use the *scaled dot-product attention* scoring function. That is, we rescale the dot-product by $1/\\sqrt{d}$. We thus arrive at the first commonly used attention function that is used, e.g., in Transformers :cite:`Vaswani.Shazeer.Parmar.ea.2017`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}_i) = \\mathbf{q}^\\top \\mathbf{k}_i / \\sqrt{d}.$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_dot_product_attention`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that attention weights $\\alpha$ still need normalizing. We can simplify this further via :eqref:`eq_softmax_attention` by using the softmax operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}_i) = \\mathrm{softmax}(a(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}_i)) = \\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{q}^\\top \\mathbf{k}_i / \\sqrt{d})}{\\sum_{j=1} \\exp(\\mathbf{q}^\\top \\mathbf{k}_j / \\sqrt{d})}.$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_attn-scoring-alpha`\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, all popular attention mechanisms use the softmax, hence we will limit ourselves to that in the remainder of this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convenience Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a few functions to make the attention mechanism efficient to deploy. This includes tools to deal with strings of variable lengths (common for natural language processing) and tools for efficient evaluation on minibatches (batch matrix multiplication). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### [**Masked Softmax Operation**]\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular applications of the attention mechanism is to sequence models. Hence we need to be able to deal with sequences of different lengths. In some cases, such sequences may end up in the same minibatch, necessitating padding with dummy tokens for shorter sequences (see :numref:`sec_machine_translation` for an example). These special tokens do not carry meaning. For instance, assume that we have the following three sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Dive  into  Deep    Learning \n",
    "Learn to    code    <blank>\n",
    "Hello world <blank> <blank>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we do not want blanks in our attention model we simply need to limit $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}_i) \\mathbf{v}_i$ to $\\sum_{i=1}^l \\alpha(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}_i) \\mathbf{v}_i$ for however long $l \\leq n$ the actual sentence is. Since it is such a common problem, it has a name: the *masked softmax operation*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement it. Actually, the implementation cheats ever so slightly by setting the values to zero $\\mathbf{v}_i = 0$ for $i > l$. Moreover, it sets the attention weights to a large negative number, such as $-10^{6}$ in order to make their contribution to gradients and values vanish in practice. This is done since linear algebra kernels and operators are heavily optimized for GPUs and it is faster to be slightly wasteful in computation rather than to have code with conditional (if then else) statements.\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we introduced the two key attention scoring functions: dot product and additive attention. They are effective tools for aggregating across sequences of variable length. In particular, the dot product attention is the mainstay of modern Transformer architectures. When queries and keys are vectors of different lengths,\n",
    "we can use the additive attention scoring function instead. Optimizing these layers is one of the key areas of advance in recent years. For instance, [Nvidia's Transformer Library](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/index.html) and Megatron :cite:`shoeybi2019megatron` crucially rely on efficient variants of the attention mechanism. We will dive into this in quite a bit more detail as we review Transformers in later sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement distance-based attention by modifying the `DotProductAttention` code. Note that you only need the squared norms of the keys $\\|\\mathbf{k}_i\\|^2$ for an efficient implementation. \n",
    "1. Modify the dot product attention to allow for queries and keys of different dimensionalities by employing a matrix to adjust dimensions. \n",
    "1. How does the computational cost scale with the dimensionality of the keys, queries, values, and their number? What about the memory bandwidth requirements?\n"
