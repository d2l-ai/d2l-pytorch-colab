    "## Maximum Pooling and Average Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Like convolutional layers, *pooling* operators\n",
    "consist of a fixed-shape window that is slid over\n",
    "all regions in the input according to its stride,\n",
    "computing a single output for each location traversed\n",
    "by the fixed-shape window (sometimes known as the *pooling window*).\n",
    "However, unlike the cross-correlation computation\n",
    "of the inputs and kernels in the convolutional layer,\n",
    "the pooling layer contains no parameters (there is no *kernel*).\n",
    "Instead, pooling operators are deterministic,\n",
    "typically calculating either the maximum or the average value\n",
    "of the elements in the pooling window.\n",
    "These operations are called *maximum pooling* (*max-pooling* for short)\n",
    "and *average pooling*, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Average pooling* is essentially as old as CNNs. The idea is akin to \n",
    "downsampling an image. Rather than just taking the value of every second (or third) \n",
    "pixel for the lower resolution image, we can average over adjacent pixels to obtain \n",
    "an image with better signal to noise ratio since we are combining the information \n",
    "from multiple adjacent pixels. *Max-pooling* was introduced in \n",
    ":citet:`Riesenhuber.Poggio.1999` in the context of cognitive neuroscience to describe \n",

    "of object recognition, and an earlier version in speech recognition :cite:`Yamaguchi.Sakamoto.Akabane.ea.1990`. In almost all cases, max-pooling, as it is also referred to, \n",
    "is preferable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, as with the cross-correlation operator,\n",
    "we can think of the pooling window\n",
    "as starting from the upper-left of the input tensor\n",
    "and sliding across the input tensor from left to right and top to bottom.\n",
    "At each location that the pooling window hits,\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling is an exceedingly simple operation. It does exactly what its name indicates, aggregate results over a window of values. All convolution semantics, such as strides and padding apply in the same way as they did previously. Note that pooling is indifferent to channels, i.e., it leaves the number of channels unchanged and it applies to each channel separately. Lastly, of the two popular pooling choices, max-pooling is preferable to average pooling, as it confers some degree of invariance to output. A popular choice is to pick a pooling window size of $2 \\times 2$ to quarter the spatial resolution of output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are many more ways of reducing resolution beyond pooling. For instance, in stochastic pooling :cite:`Zeiler.Fergus.2013` and fractional max-pooling :cite:`Graham.2014` aggregation is combined with randomization. This can slightly improve the accuracy in some cases. Lastly, as we will see later with the attention mechanism, there are more refined ways of aggregating over outputs, e.g., by using the alignment between a query and representation vectors. \n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement average pooling through a convolution. \n",
    "1. Prove that max-pooling cannot be implemented through a convolution alone. \n",
    "1. Max-pooling can be accomplished using ReLU operations, i.e., $\\mathrm{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x)$.\n",
    "    1. Express $\\max (a, b)$ by using only ReLU operations.\n",
    "    1. Use this to implement max-pooling by means of convolutions and ReLU layers. \n",
    "    1. How many channels and layers do you need for a $2 \\times 2$ convolution? How many for a $3 \\times 3$ convolution. \n",
    "1. What is the computational cost of the pooling layer? Assume that the input to the pooling layer is of size $c\\times h\\times w$, the pooling window has a shape of $p_h\\times p_w$ with a padding of $(p_h, p_w)$ and a stride of $(s_h, s_w)$.\n",
    "1. Why do you expect max-pooling and average pooling to work differently?\n",
    "1. Do we need a separate minimum pooling layer? Can you replace it with another operation?\n",
    "1. We could use the softmax operation for pooling. Why might it not be so popular?\n"
