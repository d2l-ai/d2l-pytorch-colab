    "In this section, we reviewed all the linear algebra\n",

    "There is a lot more to linear algebra\n",

    "For example, matrices can be decomposed into factors,\n",
    "and these decompositions can reveal\n",
    "low-dimensional structure in real-world datasets.\n",
    "There are entire subfields of machine learning\n",
    "that focus on using matrix decompositions\n",
    "and their generalizations to high-order tensors\n",
    "to discover structure in datasets \n",
    "and solve prediction problems.\n",
    "But this book focuses on deep learning.\n",
    "And we believe you will be more inclined \n",
    "to learn more mathematics\n",
    "once you have gotten your hands dirty\n",
    "applying machine learning to real datasets.\n",
    "So while we reserve the right \n",

    "To recap:\n",

    "* Scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors are \n",

    "* Tensors can be sliced or reduced along specified axes \n",
    "  via indexing, or operations such as `sum` and `mean`, respectively.\n",
    "* Elementwise products are called Hadamard products. \n",

    "1. Given any square matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, is $\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{A}^\\top$ always symmetric? Can you prove the result by using only the result of the previous two exercises?\n",
    "1. We defined the tensor `X` of shape (2, 3, 4) in this section. What is the output of `len(X)`? Write your answer without implementing any code, then check your answer using code. \n",
    "1. For a tensor `X` of arbitrary shape, does `len(X)` always correspond to the length of a certain axis of `X`? What is that axis?\n",
    "1. Run `A / A.sum(axis=1)` and see what happens. Can you analyze the reason?\n",
    "1. When traveling between two points in downtown Manhattan, what is the distance that you need to cover in terms of the coordinates, i.e., in terms of avenues and streets? Can you travel diagonally?\n",
    "1. Consider a tensor with shape (2, 3, 4). What are the shapes of the summation outputs along axis 0, 1, and 2?\n",
    "1. Feed a tensor with 3 or more axes to the `linalg.norm` function and observe its output. What does this function compute for tensors of arbitrary shape?\n",
    "1. Define three large matrices, say $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2^{10} \\times 2^{16}}$, $\\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2^{16} \\times 2^{5}}$ and $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2^{5} \\times 2^{14}}$, for instance initialized with Gaussian random variables. You want to compute the product $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{C}$.
