    "## Training Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "When training neural networks,\n",
    "forward and backward propagation depend on each other.\n",
    "In particular, for forward propagation,\n",
    "we traverse the computational graph in the direction of dependencies\n",
    "and compute all the variables on its path.\n",
    "These are then used for backpropagation\n",
    "where the compute order on the graph is reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the aforementioned simple network as an illustrative example.\n",
    "On the one hand,\n",
    "computing the regularization term :eqref:`eq_forward-s`\n",
    "during forward propagation\n",
    "depends on the current values of model parameters $\\mathbf{W}^{(1)}$ and $\\mathbf{W}^{(2)}$.\n",
    "They are given by the optimization algorithm according to backpropagation in the most recent iteration.\n",
    "On the other hand,\n",
    "the gradient calculation for the parameter\n",
    ":eqref:`eq_backprop-J-h` during backpropagation\n",
    "depends on the current value of the hidden layer output $\\mathbf{h}$,\n",
    "which is given by forward propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore when training neural networks, once model parameters are initialized,\n",
    "we alternate forward propagation with backpropagation,\n",
    "updating model parameters using gradients given by backpropagation.\n",
    "Note that backpropagation reuses the stored intermediate values from forward propagation to avoid duplicate calculations.\n",
    "One of the consequences is that we need to retain\n",
    "the intermediate values until backpropagation is complete.\n",
    "This is also one of the reasons why training\n",
    "requires significantly more memory than plain prediction.\n",
    "Besides, the size of such intermediate values is roughly\n",
    "proportional to the number of network layers and the batch size.\n",
    "Thus,\n",
    "training deeper networks using larger batch sizes\n",
    "more easily leads to *out-of-memory* errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward propagation sequentially calculates and stores intermediate variables within the computational graph defined by the neural network. It proceeds from the input to the output layer.\n",
    "Backpropagation sequentially calculates and stores the gradients of intermediate variables and parameters within the neural network in the reversed order.\n",
    "When training deep learning models, forward propagation and backpropagation are interdependent,\n",
    "and training requires significantly more memory than prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assume that the inputs $\\mathbf{X}$ to some scalar function $f$ are $n \\times m$ matrices. What is the dimensionality of the gradient of $f$ with respect to $\\mathbf{X}$?\n",
    "1. Add a bias to the hidden layer of the model described in this section (you do not need to include bias in the regularization term).\n",
    "    1. Draw the corresponding computational graph.\n",
    "    1. Derive the forward and backward propagation equations.\n",
    "1. Compute the memory footprint for training and prediction in the model described in this section.\n",
    "1. Assume that you want to compute second derivatives. What happens to the computational graph? How long do you expect the calculation to take?\n",
    "1. Assume that the computational graph is too large for your GPU.\n",
    "    1. Can you partition it over more than one GPU?\n",
    "    1. What are the advantages and disadvantages over training on a smaller minibatch?\n",
