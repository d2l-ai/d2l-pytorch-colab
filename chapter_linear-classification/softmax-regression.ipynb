    ":label:`sec_softmax`\n",
    "\n",
    "In :numref:`sec_linear_regression`, we introduced linear regression,\n",
    "working through implementations from scratch in :numref:`sec_linear_scratch`\n",
    "and again using high-level APIs of a deep learning framework\n",
    "in :numref:`sec_linear_concise` to do the heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is the hammer we reach for when\n",
    "we want to answer *how much?* or *how many?* questions.\n",
    "If you want to predict the number of dollars (price)\n",
    "at which a house will be sold,\n",
    "or the number of wins a baseball team might have,\n",
    "or the number of days that a patient\n",
    "will remain hospitalized before being discharged,\n",
    "then you are probably looking for a regression model.\n",
    "However, even within regression models,\n",
    "there are important distinctions.\n",
    "For instance, the price of a house\n",
    "will never be negative and changes might often be *relative* to its baseline price.\n",
    "As such, it might be more effective to regress\n",
    "on the logarithm of the price.\n",
    "Likewise, the number of days a patient spends in hospital\n",
    "is a *discrete nonnegative* random variable.\n",
    "As such, least mean squares might not be an ideal approach either.\n",
    "This sort of time-to-event modeling\n",
    "comes with a host of other complications that are dealt with\n",
    "in a specialized subfield called *survival modeling*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point here is not to overwhelm you but just\n",
    "to let you know that there is a lot more to estimation\n",
    "than simply minimizing squared errors.\n",
    "And more broadly, there is a lot more to supervised learning than regression.\n",
    "In this section, we focus on *classification* problems\n",
    "where we put aside *how much?* questions\n",
    "and instead focus on *which category?* questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does this email belong in the spam folder or the inbox?\n",
    "* Is this customer more likely to sign up\n",
    "  or not to sign up for a subscription service?\n",
    "* Does this image depict a donkey, a dog, a cat, or a rooster?\n",
    "* Which movie is Aston most likely to watch next?\n",
    "* Which section of the book are you going to read next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Colloquially, machine learning practitioners\n",
    "overload the word *classification*\n",
    "to describe two subtly different problems:\n",
    "(i) those where we are interested only in\n",
    "hard assignments of examples to categories (classes);\n",
    "and (ii) those where we wish to make soft assignments,\n",
    "i.e., to assess the probability that each category applies.\n",
    "The distinction tends to get blurred, in part,\n",
    "because often, even when we only care about hard assignments,\n",
    "we still use models that make soft assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even more, there are cases where more than one label might be true.\n",
    "For instance, a news article might simultaneously cover\n",
    "the topics of entertainment, business, and space flight,\n",
    "but not the topics of medicine or sports.\n",
    "Thus, categorizing it into one of the above categories\n",
    "on their own would not be very useful.\n",
    "This problem is commonly known as [multi-label classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-label_classification).\n",
    "See :citet:`Tsoumakas.Katakis.2007` for an overview\n",
    "and :citet:`Huang.Xu.Yu.2015`\n",
    "for an effective algorithm when tagging images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification\n",
    ":label:`subsec_classification-problem`\n",
    "\n",
    "To get our feet wet, let's start with\n",
    "a simple image classification problem.\n",
    "Here, each input consists of a $2\\times2$ grayscale image.\n",
    "We can represent each pixel value with a single scalar,\n",
    "giving us four features $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$.\n",
    "Further, let's assume that each image belongs to one\n",
    "among the categories \"cat\", \"chicken\", and \"dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have to choose how to represent the labels.\n",
    "We have two obvious choices.\n",
    "Perhaps the most natural impulse would be\n",
    "to choose $y \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$,\n",
    "where the integers represent\n",
    "$\\{\\textrm{dog}, \\textrm{cat}, \\textrm{chicken}\\}$ respectively.\n",
    "This is a great way of *storing* such information on a computer.\n",
    "If the categories had some natural ordering among them,\n",
    "say if we were trying to predict\n",
    "$\\{\\textrm{baby}, \\textrm{toddler}, \\textrm{adolescent}, \\textrm{young adult}, \\textrm{adult}, \\textrm{geriatric}\\}$,\n",
    "then it might even make sense to cast this as\n",
    "an [ordinal regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_regression) problem\n",
    "and keep the labels in this format.\n",
    "See :citet:`Moon.Smola.Chang.ea.2010` for an overview\n",
    "of different types of ranking loss functions\n",
    "and :citet:`Beutel.Murray.Faloutsos.ea.2014` for a Bayesian approach\n",
    "that addresses responses with more than one mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, classification problems do not come\n",
    "with natural orderings among the classes.\n",
    "Fortunately, statisticians long ago invented a simple way\n",
    "to represent categorical data: the *one-hot encoding*.\n",
    "A one-hot encoding is a vector\n",
    "with as many components as we have categories.\n",
    "The component corresponding to a particular instance's category is set to 1\n",
    "and all other components are set to 0.\n",
    "In our case, a label $y$ would be a three-dimensional vector,\n",
    "with $(1, 0, 0)$ corresponding to \"cat\", $(0, 1, 0)$ to \"chicken\",\n",
    "and $(0, 0, 1)$ to \"dog\":\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y \\in \\{(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)\\}.$$\n",

    "### Linear Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate the conditional probabilities\n",
    "associated with all the possible classes,\n",
    "we need a model with multiple outputs, one per class.\n",
    "To address classification with linear models,\n",
    "we will need as many affine functions as we have outputs.\n",
    "Strictly speaking, we only need one fewer,\n",
    "since the final category has to be the difference\n",
    "between $1$ and the sum of the other categories,\n",
    "but for reasons of symmetry\n",
    "we use a slightly redundant parametrization.\n",
    "Each output corresponds to its own affine function.\n",
    "In our case, since we have 4 features and 3 possible output categories,\n",
    "we need 12 scalars to represent the weights ($w$ with subscripts),\n",
    "and 3 scalars to represent the biases ($b$ with subscripts). This yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",

    "The corresponding neural network diagram\n",
    "is shown in :numref:`fig_softmaxreg`.\n",
    "Just as in linear regression,\n",
    "we use a single-layer neural network.\n",
    "And since the calculation of each output, $o_1, o_2$, and $o_3$,\n",
    "depends on every input, $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, and $x_4$,\n",
    "the output layer can also be described as a *fully connected layer*.\n",

    "### The Softmax\n",
    ":label:`subsec_softmax_operation`\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a suitable loss function,\n",
    "we could try, directly, to minimize the difference\n",
    "between $\\mathbf{o}$ and the labels $\\mathbf{y}$.\n",
    "While it turns out that treating classification\n",
    "as a vector-valued regression problem works surprisingly well,\n",
    "it is nonetheless unsatisfactory in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is no guarantee that the outputs $o_i$ sum up to $1$ in the way we expect probabilities to behave.\n",
    "* There is no guarantee that the outputs $o_i$ are even nonnegative, even if their outputs sum up to $1$, or that they do not exceed $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both aspects render the estimation problem difficult to solve\n",
    "and the solution very brittle to outliers.\n",
    "For instance, if we assume that there\n",
    "is a positive linear dependency\n",
    "between the number of bedrooms and the likelihood\n",
    "that someone will buy a house,\n",
    "the probability might exceed $1$\n",
    "when it comes to buying a mansion!\n",
    "As such, we need a mechanism to \"squish\" the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways we might accomplish this goal.\n",
    "For instance, we could assume that the outputs\n",
    "$\\mathbf{o}$ are corrupted versions of $\\mathbf{y}$,\n",
    "where the corruption occurs by means of adding noise $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$\n",
    "drawn from a normal distribution.\n",
    "In other words, $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{o} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$,\n",
    "where $\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n",
    "This is the so-called [probit model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probit_model),\n",
    "first introduced by :citet:`Fechner.1860`.\n",
    "While appealing, it does not work quite as well\n",
    "nor lead to a particularly nice optimization problem,\n",
    "when compared to the softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to accomplish this goal\n",
    "(and to ensure nonnegativity) is to use\n",
    "an exponential function $P(y = i) \\propto \\exp o_i$.\n",
    "This does indeed satisfy the requirement\n",
    "that the conditional class probability\n",
    "increases with increasing $o_i$, it is monotonic,\n",
    "and all probabilities are nonnegative.\n",
    "We can then transform these values so that they add up to $1$\n",
    "by dividing each by their sum.\n",
    "This process is called *normalization*.\n",
    "Putting these two pieces together\n",
    "gives us the *softmax* function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathrm{softmax}(\\mathbf{o}) \\quad \\textrm{where}\\quad \\hat{y}_i = \\frac{\\exp(o_i)}{\\sum_j \\exp(o_j)}.$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_softmax_y_and_o`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the largest coordinate of $\\mathbf{o}$\n",
    "corresponds to the most likely class according to $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\n",
    "Moreover, because the softmax operation\n",
    "preserves the ordering among its arguments,\n",
    "we do not need to compute the softmax\n",
    "to determine which class has been assigned the highest probability. Thus,\n",

    "The idea of a softmax dates back to :citet:`Gibbs.1902`,\n",
    "who adapted ideas from physics.\n",
    "Dating even further back, Boltzmann,\n",
    "the father of modern statistical physics,\n",
    "used this trick to model a distribution\n",

    "In particular, he discovered that the prevalence\n",

    "is proportional to $\\exp(-E/kT)$.\n",
    "Here, $E$ is the energy of a state,\n",

    "\n",
    "This accelerates the dominant operation into\n",
    "a matrix--matrix product $\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}$.\n",
    "Moreover, since each row in $\\mathbf{X}$ represents a data example,\n",
    "the softmax operation itself can be computed *rowwise*:\n",
    "for each row of $\\mathbf{O}$, exponentiate all entries\n",
    "and then normalize them by the sum.\n",
    "Note, though, that care must be taken\n",
    "to avoid exponentiating and taking logarithms of large numbers,\n",
    "since this can cause numerical overflow or underflow.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Loss Function\n",
    ":label:`subsec_softmax-regression-loss-func`\n",

    "Now that we have a mapping from features $\\mathbf{x}$\n",
    "to probabilities $\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}$,\n",
    "we need a way to optimize the accuracy of this mapping.\n",
    "We will rely on maximum likelihood estimation,\n",

    "when providing a probabilistic justification\n",
    "for the mean squared error loss in\n",
    ":numref:`subsec_normal_distribution_and_squared_loss`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Log-Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "The softmax function gives us a vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$,\n",
    "which we can interpret as the (estimated) conditional probabilities\n",
    "of each class, given any input $\\mathbf{x}$,\n",
    "such as $\\hat{y}_1$ = $P(y=\\textrm{cat} \\mid \\mathbf{x})$.\n",
    "In the following we assume that for a dataset\n",
    "with features $\\mathbf{X}$ the labels $\\mathbf{Y}$\n",
    "are represented using a one-hot encoding label vector.\n",
    "We can compare the estimates with reality\n",

    "If it is always easy for us to predict the next token,\n",
    "then this data is easy to compress.\n",
    "Take the extreme example where every token in the stream\n",
    "always takes the same value.\n",
    "That is a very boring data stream!\n",
    "And not only it is boring, but it is also easy to predict.\n",
    "Because the tokens are always the same,\n",
    "we do not have to transmit any information\n",
    "to communicate the contents of the stream.\n",
    "Easy to predict, easy to compress.\n",
    "\n",
    "However if we cannot perfectly predict every event,\n",
    "then we might sometimes be surprised.\n",
    "Our surprise is greater when an event is assigned lower probability.\n",
    "Claude Shannon settled on $\\log \\frac{1}{P(j)} = -\\log P(j)$\n",

    "The entropy defined in :eqref:`eq_softmax_reg_entropy`\n",

    "### Cross-Entropy Revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "So if entropy is the level of surprise experienced\n",
    "by someone who knows the true probability,\n",
    "then you might be wondering, what is cross-entropy?\n",
    "The cross-entropy *from* $P$ *to* $Q$, denoted $H(P, Q)$,\n",
    "is the expected surprisal of an observer with subjective probabilities $Q$\n",
    "upon seeing data that was actually generated according to probabilities $P$.\n",
    "This is given by $H(P, Q) \\stackrel{\\textrm{def}}{=} \\sum_j - P(j) \\log Q(j)$.\n",
    "The lowest possible cross-entropy is achieved when $P=Q$.\n",
    "In this case, the cross-entropy from $P$ to $Q$ is $H(P, P)= H(P)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we can think of the cross-entropy classification objective\n",
    "in two ways: (i) as maximizing the likelihood of the observed data;\n",
    "and (ii) as minimizing our surprisal (and thus the number of bits)\n",
    "required to communicate the labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we encountered the first nontrivial loss function,\n",
    "allowing us to optimize over *discrete* output spaces.\n",
    "Key in its design was that we took a probabilistic approach,\n",
    "treating discrete categories as instances of draws from a probability distribution.\n",
    "As a side effect, we encountered the softmax,\n",
    "a convenient activation function that transforms\n",
    "outputs of an ordinary neural network layer\n",
    "into valid discrete probability distributions.\n",
    "We saw that the derivative of the cross-entropy loss\n",
    "when combined with softmax\n",
    "behaves very similarly\n",
    "to the derivative of squared error;\n",
    "namely by taking the difference between\n",
    "the expected behavior and its prediction.\n",
    "And, while we were only able to\n",
    "scratch the very surface of it,\n",
    "we encountered exciting connections\n",
    "to statistical physics and information theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is enough to get you on your way,\n",
    "and hopefully enough to whet your appetite,\n",
    "we hardly dived deep here.\n",
    "Among other things, we skipped over computational considerations.\n",
    "Specifically, for any fully connected layer with $d$ inputs and $q$ outputs,\n",
    "the parametrization and computational cost is $\\mathcal{O}(dq)$,\n",
    "which can be prohibitively high in practice.\n",
    "Fortunately, this cost of transforming $d$ inputs into $q$ outputs\n",
    "can be reduced through approximation and compression.\n",
    "For instance Deep Fried Convnets :cite:`Yang.Moczulski.Denil.ea.2015`\n",
    "uses a combination of permutations,\n",
    "Fourier transforms, and scaling\n",
    "to reduce the cost from quadratic to log-linear.\n",
    "Similar techniques work for more advanced\n",
    "structural matrix approximations :cite:`sindhwani2015structured`.\n",
    "Lastly, we can use quaternion-like decompositions\n",
    "to reduce the cost to $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{dq}{n})$,\n",
    "again if we are willing to trade off a small amount of accuracy\n",
    "for computational and storage cost :cite:`Zhang.Tay.Zhang.ea.2021`\n",
    "based on a compression factor $n$.\n",
    "This is an active area of research.\n",
    "What makes it challenging is that\n",
    "we do not necessarily strive\n",
    "for the most compact representation\n",
    "or the smallest number of floating point operations\n",
    "but rather for the solution\n",
    "that can be executed most efficiently on modern GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can explore the connection between exponential families and softmax in some more depth.\n",
    "    1. Compute the second derivative of the cross-entropy loss $l(\\mathbf{y},\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$ for softmax.\n",
    "    1. Compute the variance of the distribution given by $\\mathrm{softmax}(\\mathbf{o})$ and show that it matches the second derivative computed above.\n",
    "1. Assume that we have three classes which occur with equal probability, i.e., the probability vector is $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\n",
    "    1. What is the problem if we try to design a binary code for it?\n",
    "    1. Can you design a better code? Hint: what happens if we try to encode two independent observations? What if we encode $n$ observations jointly?\n",
    "1. When encoding signals transmitted over a physical wire, engineers do not always use binary codes. For instance, [PAM-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_signal) uses three signal levels $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ as opposed to two levels $\\{0, 1\\}$. How many ternary units do you need to transmit an integer in the range $\\{0, \\ldots, 7\\}$? Why might this be a better idea in terms of electronics?\n",
    "1. The [Bradley--Terry model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model) uses\n",
    "a logistic model to capture preferences. For a user to choose between apples and oranges one\n",
    "assumes scores $o_{\\textrm{apple}}$ and $o_{\\textrm{orange}}$. Our requirements are that larger scores should lead to a higher likelihood in choosing the associated item and that\n",
    "the item with the largest score is the most likely one to be chosen :cite:`Bradley.Terry.1952`.\n",
    "    1. Prove that softmax satisfies this requirement.\n",
    "    1. What happens if you want to allow for a default option of choosing neither apples nor oranges? Hint: now the user has three choices.\n",
    "1. Softmax gets its name from the following mapping: $\\textrm{RealSoftMax}(a, b) = \\log (\\exp(a) + \\exp(b))$.\n",
    "    1. Prove that $\\textrm{RealSoftMax}(a, b) > \\mathrm{max}(a, b)$.\n",
    "    1. How small can you make the difference between both functions? Hint: without loss of\n",
    "    generality you can set $b = 0$ and $a \\geq b$.\n",
    "    1. Prove that this holds for $\\lambda^{-1} \\textrm{RealSoftMax}(\\lambda a, \\lambda b)$, provided that $\\lambda > 0$.\n",
    "    1. Show that for $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ we have $\\lambda^{-1} \\textrm{RealSoftMax}(\\lambda a, \\lambda b) \\to \\mathrm{max}(a, b)$.\n",
    "    1. Construct an analogous softmin function.\n",
    "    1. Extend this to more than two numbers.\n",
    "1. The function $g(\\mathbf{x}) \\stackrel{\\textrm{def}}{=} \\log \\sum_i \\exp x_i$ is sometimes also referred to as the [log-partition function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(mathematics)).\n",
    "    1. Prove that the function is convex. Hint: to do so, use the fact that the first derivative amounts to the probabilities from the softmax function and show that the second derivative is the variance.\n",
    "    1. Show that $g$ is translation invariant, i.e., $g(\\mathbf{x} + b) = g(\\mathbf{x})$.\n",
    "    1. What happens if some of the coordinates $x_i$ are very large? What happens if they're all very small?\n",
    "    1. Show that if we choose $b = \\mathrm{max}_i x_i$ we end up with a numerically stable implementation.\n",
    "1. Assume that we have some probability distribution $P$. Suppose we pick another distribution $Q$ with $Q(i) \\propto P(i)^\\alpha$ for $\\alpha > 0$.\n",
    "    1. Which choice of $\\alpha$ corresponds to doubling the temperature? Which choice corresponds to halving it?\n",
    "    1. What happens if we let the temperature approach $0$?\n",
    "    1. What happens if we let the temperature approach $\\infty$?\n",
