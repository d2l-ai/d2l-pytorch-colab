    "# Using AWS EC2 Instances\n",
    ":label:`sec_aws`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will show you how to install all libraries on a raw Linux machine. Recall that in :numref:`sec_sagemaker` we discussed how to use Amazon SageMaker, while building an instance by yourself costs less on AWS. The walkthrough includes three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Request for a GPU Linux instance from AWS EC2.\n",
    "1. Install CUDA (or use an Amazon Machine Image with preinstalled CUDA).\n",
    "1. Install the deep learning framework and other libraries for running the code of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process applies to other instances (and other clouds), too, albeit with some minor modifications. Before going forward, you need to create an AWS account, see :numref:`sec_sagemaker` for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating and Running an EC2 Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "After logging into your AWS account, click \"EC2\" (:numref:`fig_aws`) to go to the EC2 panel.\n",

    "### Presetting Location\n",
    "Select a nearby data center to reduce latency, e.g., \"Oregon\" (marked by the red box in the top-right of :numref:`fig_ec2`). If you are located in China,\n",
    "you can select a nearby Asia Pacific region, such as Seoul or Tokyo. Please note\n",
    "that some data centers may not have GPU instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Increasing Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "Before choosing an instance, check if there are quantity\n",
    "restrictions by clicking the \"Limits\" label in the bar on the left as shown in\n",
    ":numref:`fig_ec2`. \n",
    ":numref:`fig_limits` shows an example of such a\n",
    "limitation. The account currently cannot open \"p2.xlarge\" instances according to the region. If\n",
    "you need to open one or more instances, click on the \"Request limit increase\" link to\n",

    "## Installing Libraries for Running the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code of this book,\n",
    "just follow steps in :ref:`chap_installation`\n",
    "for Linux users on the EC2 instance\n",
    "and use the following tips \n",
    "for working on a remote Linux server:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To download the bash script on the Miniconda installation page, right click the download link and select \"Copy Link Address\", then execute `wget [copied link address]`.\n",
    "* After running `~/miniconda3/bin/conda init`, you may execute `source ~/.bashrc` instead of closing and reopening your current shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Jupyter Notebook remotely\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the Jupyter Notebook remotely you need to use SSH port forwarding. After all, the server in the cloud does not have a monitor or keyboard. For this, log into your server from your desktop (or laptop) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This command must be run in the local command line\n",
    "ssh -i \"/path/to/key.pem\" ubuntu@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.y.compute.amazonaws.com -L 8889:localhost:8888\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, go to the location \n",
    "of the downloaded code of this book\n",
    "on the EC2 instance,\n",
    "then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate d2l\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ":numref:`fig_jupyter` shows the possible output after you run the Jupyter Notebook. The last row is the URL for port 8888.\n",
    "\n",

    ":width:`700px`\n",
    ":label:`fig_jupyter`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you used port forwarding to port 8889,\n",
    "copy the last row in the red box of :numref:`fig_jupyter`,\n",
    "replace \"8888\" with \"8889\" in the URL,\n",
    "and open it in your local browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Closing Unused Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "As cloud services are billed by the time of use, you should close instances that are not being used. Note that there are alternatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Stopping\" an instance means that you will be able to start it again. This is akin to switching off the power for your regular server. However, stopped instances will still be billed a small amount for the hard disk space retained. \n",
    "* \"Terminating\" an instance will delete all data associated with it. This includes the disk, hence you cannot start it again. Only do this if you know that you will not need it in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use the instance as a template for many more instances,\n",
    "right-click on the example in :numref:`fig_connect` and select \"Image\" $\\rightarrow$\n",
    "\"Create\" to create an image of the instance. Once this is complete, select\n",
    "\"Instance State\" $\\rightarrow$ \"Terminate\" to terminate the instance. The next\n",
    "time you want to use this instance, you can follow the steps in this section \n",
    "to create an instance based on\n",
    "the saved image. The only difference is that, in \"1. Choose AMI\" shown in\n",
    ":numref:`fig_ubuntu`, you must use the \"My AMIs\" option on the left to select your saved\n",
    "image. The created instance will retain the information stored on the image hard\n",
    "disk. For example, you will not have to reinstall CUDA and other runtime\n",
    "environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can launch and stop instances on demand without having to buy and build our own computer.\n",
    "* We need to install CUDA before using the GPU-enabled deep learning framework.\n",
    "* We can use port forwarding to run the Jupyter Notebook on a remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The cloud offers convenience, but it does not come cheap. Find out how to launch [spot instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) to see how to reduce costs.\n",
    "1. Experiment with different GPU servers. How fast are they?\n",
    "1. Experiment with multi-GPU servers. How well can you scale things up?\n",
