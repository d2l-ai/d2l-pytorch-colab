    "\n",
    "In order to get up and running,\n",

    "## Installing Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Your simplest option is to install\n",
    "[Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n",
    "Note that the Python 3.x version is required.\n",
    "You can skip the following steps\n",
    "if your machine already has conda installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit the Miniconda website and determine\n",
    "the appropriate version for your system\n",
    "based on your Python 3.x version and machine architecture.\n",
    "Suppose that your Python version is 3.9\n",
    "(our tested version).\n",
    "If you are using macOS,\n",
    "you would download the bash script\n",
    "whose name contains the strings \"MacOSX\",\n",
    "navigate to the download location,\n",
    "and execute the installation as follows\n",
    "(taking Intel Macs as an example):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# The file name is subject to changes\n",
    "sh Miniconda3-py39_4.12.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A Linux user\n",
    "would download the file\n",
    "whose name contains the strings \"Linux\"\n",
    "and execute the following at the download location:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# The file name is subject to changes\n",
    "sh Miniconda3-py39_4.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh -b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A Windows user would download and install Miniconda by following its [online instructions](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n",
    "On Windows, you may search for `cmd` to open the Command Prompt (command-line interpreter) for running commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, initialize the shell so we can run `conda` directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "~/miniconda3/bin/conda init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then close and reopen your current shell.\n",
    "You should be able to create\n",
    "a new environment as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name d2l python=3.9 -y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can activate the `d2l` environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate d2l\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing the Deep Learning Framework and the `d2l` Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Before installing any deep learning framework,\n",
    "please first check whether or not\n",
    "you have proper GPUs on your machine\n",
    "(the GPUs that power the display\n",
    "on a standard laptop are not relevant for our purposes).\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "if your computer has NVIDIA GPUs and has installed [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads),\n",
    "then you are all set.\n",
    "If your machine does not house any GPU,\n",
    "there is no need to worry just yet.\n",
    "Your CPU provides more than enough horsepower\n",
    "to get you through the first few chapters.\n",
    "Just remember that you will want to access GPUs\n",
    "before running larger models.\n"
