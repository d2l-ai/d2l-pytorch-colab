    "While implementing the above RNN model from scratch is instructive, it is not convenient.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can train an RNN-based character-level language model to generate text following the user-provided text prefix.\n",
    "* A simple RNN language model consists of input encoding, RNN modeling, and output generation.\n",
    "* RNN models need state initialization for training, though random sampling and sequential partitioning use different ways.\n",
    "* When using sequential partitioning, we need to detach the gradient to reduce computational cost.\n",
    "* A warm-up period allows a model to update itself (e.g., obtain a better hidden state than its initialized value) before making any prediction.\n",
    "* Gradient clipping prevents gradient explosion, but it cannot fix vanishing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show that one-hot encoding is equivalent to picking a different embedding for each object.\n",
    "1. Adjust the hyperparameters (e.g., number of epochs, number of hidden units, number of time steps in a minibatch, and learning rate) to improve the perplexity.\n",
    "    * How low can you go?\n",
    "    * Replace one-hot encoding with learnable embeddings. Does this lead to better performance?\n",
    "    * How well will it work on other books by H. G. Wells, e.g., [*The War of the Worlds*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36)?\n",
    "1. Modify the prediction function such as to use sampling rather than picking the most likely next character.\n",
    "    * What happens?\n",
    "    * Bias the model towards more likely outputs, e.g., by sampling from $q(x_t \\mid x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_1) \\propto P(x_t \\mid x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_1)^\\alpha$ for $\\alpha > 1$.\n",
    "1. Run the code in this section without clipping the gradient. What happens?\n",
    "1. Change sequential partitioning so that it does not separate hidden states from the computational graph. Does the running time change? How about the perplexity?\n",
    "1. Replace the activation function used in this section with ReLU and repeat the experiments in this section. Do we still need gradient clipping? Why?\n"
