    "# Asynchronous Computation\n",
    ":label:`sec_async`\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's computers are highly parallel systems, consisting of multiple CPU cores (often multiple threads per core), multiple processing elements per GPU and often multiple GPUs per device. In short, we can process many different things at the same time, often on different devices. Unfortunately Python is not a great way of writing parallel and asynchronous code, at least not with some extra help. After all, Python is single-threaded and this is unlikely to change in the future. Deep learning frameworks such as MXNet and TensorFlow utilize an asynchronous programming model to improve performance (PyTorch uses Python's own scheduler leading to a different performance trade-off).\n",
    "For PyTorch, by default, GPU operations are asynchronous. When you call a function that uses the GPU, the operations are enqueued to the particular device, but not necessarily executed until later. This allows us to execute more computations in parallel, including operations on CPU or other GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, understanding how asynchronous programming works helps us to develop more efficient programs, by proactively reducing computational requirements and mutual dependencies. This allows us to reduce memory overhead and increase processor utilization. We begin by importing the necessary libraries.\n"

It needs access to the values just like the `print` function.

    "On a heavily multithreaded system (even regular laptops have 4 threads or more and on multi-socket servers this number can exceed 256) the overhead of scheduling operations can become significant. This is why it is highly desirable to have computation and scheduling occur asynchronously and in parallel. To illustrate the benefit of doing this let us see what happens if we increment a variable by 1 multiple times, both in sequence or asynchronously. We simulate synchronous execution by inserting a `wait_to_read()` barrier in between each addition.\n"

    "A slightly simplified interaction between the Python frontend thread and the C++ backend thread can be summarized as follows:\n",

    "1. The frontend orders the backend to insert the calculation task `y = x + 1` into the queue.\n",
    "1. The backend then receives the computation tasks from the queue and performs the actual computations.\n",
    "1. The backend then returns the computation results to the frontend.\n",

If asynchronous programming is used, the total time taken to perform 1000 computations can be reduced to $t_1 + 1000 t_2 + t_3$ (assuming $1000 t_2 > 999t_1$), since the frontend does not have to wait for the backend to return computation results for each loop.\n",

For instance, the frontend might insert a large number of minibatch tasks within a very short time. After all, if no meaningful computation happens in Python this can be done quite quickly. If each of these tasks can be launched quickly at the same time this may cause a spike in memory usage. Given a finite amount of memory available on GPUs (and even on CPUs) this can lead to resource contention or even program crashes. Some readers might have noticed that previous training routines made use of synchronization methods such as `item` or even `asnumpy`.\n",

    "1. How would you need to modify the training loop if you wanted to have an overlap of one minibatch each? I.e., if you wanted to ensure that batch $b_t$ finishes before batch $b_{t+2}$ commences?\n",
    "1. What might happen if we want to execute code on CPUs and GPUs simultaneously? Should you still insist on synchronizing after every minibatch has been issued?\n",
    "1. Measure the difference between `waitall` and `wait_to_read`. Hint: perform a number of instructions and synchronize for an intermediate result.\n"
