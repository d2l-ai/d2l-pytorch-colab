However, if $\\mathcal{F} \\not\\subseteq \\mathcal{F}'$ there is no guarantee that this should even happen. In fact, $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}'}$ might well be worse.\n",

    "One of the challenges one encounters in the design of ResNet is the trade-off between nonlinearity and dimensionality within a given block. That is, we could add more nonlinearity by increasing the number of layers, or by increasing the width of the convolutions. An alternative strategy is to increase the number of channels that can carry information between blocks. Unfortunately, the latter comes with a quadratic penalty since the computational cost of ingesting $c_\\textrm{i}$ channels and emitting $c_\\textrm{o}$ channels is proportional to $\\mathcal{O}(c_\\textrm{i} \\cdot c_\\textrm{o})$ (see our discussion in :numref:`sec_channels`). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can take some inspiration from the Inception block of :numref:`fig_inception` which has information flowing through the block in separate groups. Applying the idea of multiple independent groups to the ResNet block of :numref:`fig_resnet_block` led to the design of ResNeXt :cite:`Xie.Girshick.Dollar.ea.2017`.\n",
    "Different from the smorgasbord of transformations in Inception, \n",
    "ResNeXt adopts the *same* transformation in all branches,\n",
    "thus minimizing the need for manual tuning of each branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "![The ResNeXt block. The use of grouped convolution with $\\mathit{g}$ groups is $\\mathit{g}$ times faster than a dense convolution. It is a bottleneck residual block when the number of intermediate channels $\\mathit{b}$ is less than $\\mathit{c}$.](../img/resnext-block.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_resnext_block`\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking up a convolution from $c_\\textrm{i}$ to $c_\\textrm{o}$ channels into one of $g$ groups of size $c_\\textrm{i}/g$ generating $g$ outputs of size $c_\\textrm{o}/g$ is called, quite fittingly, a *grouped convolution*. The computational cost (proportionally) is reduced from $\\mathcal{O}(c_\\textrm{i} \\cdot c_\\textrm{o})$ to $\\mathcal{O}(g \\cdot (c_\\textrm{i}/g) \\cdot (c_\\textrm{o}/g)) = \\mathcal{O}(c_\\textrm{i} \\cdot c_\\textrm{o} / g)$, i.e., it is $g$ times faster. Even better, the number of parameters needed to generate the output is also reduced from a $c_\\textrm{i} \\times c_\\textrm{o}$ matrix to $g$ smaller matrices of size $(c_\\textrm{i}/g) \\times (c_\\textrm{o}/g)$, again a $g$ times reduction. In what follows we assume that both $c_\\textrm{i}$ and $c_\\textrm{o}$ are divisible by $g$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only challenge in this design is that no information is exchanged between the $g$ groups. The ResNeXt block of \n",
    ":numref:`fig_resnext_block` amends this in two ways: the grouped convolution with a $3 \\times 3$ kernel is sandwiched in between two $1 \\times 1$ convolutions. The second one serves double duty in changing the number of channels back. The benefit is that we only pay the $\\mathcal{O}(c \\cdot b)$ cost for $1 \\times 1$ kernels and can make do with an $\\mathcal{O}(b^2 / g)$ cost for $3 \\times 3$ kernels. Similar to the residual block implementation in\n",
    ":numref:`subsec_residual-blks`, the residual connection is replaced (thus generalized) by a $1 \\times 1$ convolution.\n",

    "The right-hand figure in :numref:`fig_resnext_block` provides a much more concise summary of the resulting network block. It will also play a major role in the design of generic modern CNNs in :numref:`sec_cnn-design`. Note that the idea of grouped convolutions dates back to the implementation of AlexNet :cite:`Krizhevsky.Sutskever.Hinton.2012`. When distributing the network across two GPUs with limited memory, the implementation treated each GPU as its own channel with no ill effects. \n",

    "The following implementation of the `ResNeXtBlock` class takes as argument `groups` ($g$), with \n",
    "`bot_channels` ($b$) intermediate (bottleneck) channels. Lastly, when we need to reduce the height and width of the representation, we add a stride of $2$ by setting `use_1x1conv=True, strides=2`.\n"

    "\n",
    "Nested function classes are desirable since they allow us to obtain strictly *more powerful* rather than also subtly *different* function classes when adding capacity. One way of accomplishing this is by letting additional layers to simply pass through the input to the output. Residual connections allow for this. As a consequence, this changes the inductive bias from simple functions being of the form $f(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$ to simple functions looking like $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual mapping can learn the identity function more easily, such as pushing parameters in the weight layer to zero. We can train an effective *deep* neural network by having residual blocks. Inputs can forward propagate faster through the residual connections across layers. As a consequence, we can thus train much deeper networks. For instance, the original ResNet paper :cite:`He.Zhang.Ren.ea.2016` allowed for up to 152 layers. Another benefit of residual networks is that it allows us to add layers, initialized as the identity function, *during* the training process. After all, the default behavior of a layer is to let the data pass through unchanged. This can accelerate the training of very large networks in some cases. \n",

    "Using identity functions as bypassing paths,\n",
    "ResNet performed remarkably well\n",
    "on multiple computer vision tasks.\n",

    "in areas as diverse as\n",
    "language, vision, speech, and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNeXt is an example for how the design of convolutional neural networks has evolved over time: by being more frugal with computation and trading it off against the size of the activations (number of channels), it allows for faster and more accurate networks at lower cost. An alternative way of viewing grouped convolutions is to think of a block-diagonal matrix for the convolutional weights. Note that there are quite a few such \"tricks\" that lead to more efficient networks. For instance, ShiftNet :cite:`wu2018shift` mimicks the effects of a $3 \\times 3$ convolution, simply by adding shifted activations to the channels, offering increased function complexity, this time without any computational cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common feature of the designs we have discussed so far is that the network design is fairly manual, primarily relying on the ingenuity of the designer to find the \"right\" network hyperparameters. While clearly feasible, it is also very costly in terms of human time and there is no guarantee that the outcome is optimal in any sense. In :numref:`sec_cnn-design` we will discuss a number of strategies for obtaining high quality networks in a more automated fashion. In particular, we will review the notion of *network design spaces* that led to the RegNetX/Y models\n",
