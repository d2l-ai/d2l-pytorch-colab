    "it maps the encoded state of a fixed shape\n",
    "to a variable-length sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The encoder-decoder architecture can handle inputs and outputs that are both variable-length sequences, thus is suitable for sequence transduction problems such as machine translation.\n",

    "1. Suppose that we use neural networks to implement the encoder-decoder architecture. Do the encoder and the decoder have to be the same type of neural network?  \n",
    "1. Besides machine translation, can you think of another application where the encoder-decoder architecture can be applied?\n"
