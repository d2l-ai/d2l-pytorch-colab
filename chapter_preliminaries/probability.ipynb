    "In the case of rolling a single coin,\n",
    "$\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{tails}\\}$.\n",

    "*Events* are subsets of the sample space.\n",
    "For instance, the event \"the first coin toss comes up heads\"\n",

    "then $\\mathcal{A}$ did not occur\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A *probability* function maps events\n",
    "onto real values ${P: \\mathcal{A} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow [0,1]}$.\n",
    "The probability, denoted $P(\\mathcal{A})$, of an event $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
    "in the given sample space $\\mathcal{S}$,\n",

    "\n",
    "* The probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$ is a nonnegative real number, i.e., $P(\\mathcal{A}) \\geq 0$;\n",
    "* The probability of the entire sample space is $1$, i.e., $P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1$;\n",
    "* For any countable sequence of events $\\mathcal{A}_1, \\mathcal{A}_2, \\ldots$ that are *mutually exclusive* (i.e., $\\mathcal{A}_i \\cap \\mathcal{A}_j = \\emptyset$ for all $i \\neq j$), the probability that any of them happens is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities, i.e., $P(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{A}_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} P(\\mathcal{A}_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These axioms of probability theory,\n",

    "Consequently, the probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
    "*and* its complement $\\mathcal{A}'$ occurring simultaneously\n",

    "## Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When we spoke about events like the roll of a die\n",
    "coming up odds or the first coin toss coming up heads,\n",
    "we were invoking the idea of a *random variable*.\n",
    "Formally, random variables are mappings\n",
    "from an underlying sample space\n",
    "to a set of (possibly many) values.\n",
    "You might wonder how a random variable\n",
    "is different from the sample space,\n",
    "since both are collections of outcomes.\n",
    "Importantly, random variables can be much coarser\n",
    "than the raw sample space.\n",
    "We can define a binary random variable like \"greater than 0.5\"\n",
    "even when the underlying sample space is infinite,\n",
    "e.g., points on the line segment between $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "Additionally, multiple random variables\n",
    "can share the same underlying sample space.\n",
    "For example \"whether my home alarm goes off\"\n",
    "and \"whether my house was burgled\"\n",
    "are both binary random variables\n",
    "that share an underlying sample space.\n",
    "Consequently, knowing the value taken by one random variable\n",
    "can tell us something about the likely value of another random variable.\n",
    "Knowing that the alarm went off,\n",
    "we might suspect that the house was likely burgled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every value taken by a random variable corresponds\n",
    "to a subset of the underlying sample space.\n",
    "Thus the occurrence where the random variable $X$\n",
    "takes value $v$, denoted by $X=v$, is an *event*\n",
    "and $P(X=v)$ denotes its probability.\n",
    "Sometimes this notation can get clunky,\n",
    "and we can abuse notation when the context is clear.\n",
    "For example, we might use $P(X)$ to refer broadly\n",
    "to the *distribution* of $X$, i.e.,\n",
    "the function that tells us the probability\n",
    "that $X$ takes any given value.\n",
    "Other times we write expressions\n",
    "like $P(X,Y) = P(X) P(Y)$,\n",
    "as a shorthand to express a statement\n",
    "that is true for all of the values\n",
    "that the random variables $X$ and $Y$ can take, i.e.,\n",
    "for all $i,j$ it holds that $P(X=i \\textrm{ and } Y=j) = P(X=i)P(Y=j)$.\n",
    "Other times, we abuse notation by writing\n",
    "$P(v)$ when the random variable is clear from the context.\n",
    "Since an event in probability theory is a set of outcomes from the sample space,\n",
    "we can specify a range of values for a random variable to take.\n",
    "For example, $P(1 \\leq X \\leq 3)$ denotes the probability of the event $\\{1 \\leq X \\leq 3\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a subtle difference\n",
    "between *discrete* random variables,\n",
    "like flips of a coin or tosses of a die,\n",
    "and *continuous* ones,\n",
    "like the weight and the height of a person\n",
    "sampled at random from the population.\n",
    "In this case we seldom really care about\n",
    "someone's exact height.\n",
    "Moreover, if we took precise enough measurements,\n",
    "we would find that no two people on the planet\n",
    "have the exact same height.\n",
    "In fact, with fine enough measurements,\n",
    "you would never have the same height\n",
    "when you wake up and when you go to sleep.\n",
    "There is little point in asking about\n",
    "the exact probability that someone\n",
    "is 1.801392782910287192 meters tall.\n",
    "Instead, we typically care more about being able to say\n",
    "whether someone's height falls into a given interval,\n",
    "say between 1.79 and 1.81 meters.\n",
    "In these cases we work with probability *densities*.\n",
    "The height of exactly 1.80 meters\n",
    "has no probability, but nonzero density.\n",
    "To work out the probability assigned to an interval,\n",
    "we must take an *integral* of the density\n",
    "over that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that we could not even\n",
    "make it through the previous section without\n",
    "making statements involving interactions\n",
    "among multiple random variables\n",
    "(recall $P(X,Y) = P(X) P(Y)$).\n",
    "Most of machine learning\n",
    "is concerned with such relationships.\n",
    "Here, the sample space would be\n",
    "the population of interest,\n",
    "say customers who transact with a business,\n",
    "photographs on the Internet,\n",
    "or proteins known to biologists.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, there are many things to be uncertain about!\n",
    "We can be uncertain about the value of a label given an input.\n",
    "We can be uncertain about the estimated value of a parameter.\n",
    "We can even be uncertain about whether data arriving at deployment\n",
    "is even from the same distribution as the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By *aleatoric uncertainty*, we mean uncertainty\n",
    "that is intrinsic to the problem,\n",
    "and due to genuine randomness\n",
    "unaccounted for by the observed variables.\n",
    "By *epistemic uncertainty*, we mean uncertainty\n",
    "over a model's parameters, the sort of uncertainty\n",
    "that we can hope to reduce by collecting more data.\n",
    "We might have epistemic uncertainty\n",
    "concerning the probability\n",
    "that a coin turns up heads,\n",
    "but even once we know this probability,\n",
    "we are left with aleatoric uncertainty\n",
    "about the outcome of any future toss.\n",
    "No matter how long we watch someone tossing a fair coin,\n",
    "we will never be more or less than 50% certain\n",
    "that the next toss will come up heads.\n",
    "These terms come from mechanical modeling,\n",
    "(see e.g., :citet:`Der-Kiureghian.Ditlevsen.2009` for a review on this aspect of [uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification)).\n",
    "It is worth noting, however, that these terms constitute a slight abuse of language.\n",
    "The term *epistemic* refers to anything concerning *knowledge*\n",
    "and thus, in the philosophical sense, all uncertainty is epistemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that sampling data from some unknown probability distribution\n",
    "can provide us with information that can be used to estimate\n",
    "the parameters of the data generating distribution.\n",
    "That said, the rate at which this is possible can be quite slow.\n",
    "In our coin tossing example (and many others)\n",
    "we can do no better than to design estimators\n",
    "that converge at a rate of $1/\\sqrt{n}$,\n",
    "where $n$ is the sample size (e.g., the number of tosses).\n",
    "This means that by going from 10 to 1000 observations (usually a very achievable task)\n",
    "we see a tenfold reduction of uncertainty,\n",
    "whereas the next 1000 observations help comparatively little,\n",
    "offering only a 1.41 times reduction.\n",
    "This is a persistent feature of machine learning:\n",
    "while there are often easy gains, it takes a very large amount of data,\n",
    "and often with it an enormous amount of computation, to make further gains.\n",
    "For an empirical review of this fact for large scale language models see :citet:`Revels.Lubin.Papamarkou.2016`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also sharpened our language and tools for statistical modeling.\n",
    "In the process of that we learned about conditional probabilities\n",
    "and about one of the most important equations in statistics---Bayes' theorem.\n",
    "It is an effective tool for decoupling information conveyed by data\n",
    "through a likelihood term $P(B \\mid A)$ that addresses\n",
    "how well observations $B$ match a choice of parameters $A$,\n",
    "and a prior probability $P(A)$ which governs how plausible\n",
    "a particular choice of $A$ was in the first place.\n",
    "In particular, we saw how this rule can be applied\n",
    "to assign probabilities to diagnoses,\n",
    "based on the efficacy of the test *and*\n",
    "the prevalence of the disease itself (i.e., our prior).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we introduced a first set of nontrivial questions\n",
    "about the effect of a specific probability distribution,\n",
    "namely expectations and variances.\n",
    "While there are many more than just linear and quadratic\n",
    "expectations for a probability distribution,\n",
    "these two already provide a good deal of knowledge\n",
    "about the possible behavior of the distribution.\n",
    "For instance, [Chebyshev's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality)\n",
    "states that $P(|X - \\mu| \\geq k \\sigma) \\leq 1/k^2$,\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the expectation, $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the distribution,\n",
    "and $k > 1$ is a confidence parameter of our choosing.\n",
    "It tells us that draws from a distribution lie\n",
    "with at least 50% probability\n",
    "within a $[-\\sqrt{2} \\sigma, \\sqrt{2} \\sigma]$\n",
    "interval centered on the expectation.\n",

    "1. Give an example where observing more data can reduce the amount of uncertainty about the outcome to an arbitrarily low level.\n",
    "1. Give an example where observing more data will only reduce the amount of uncertainty up to a point and then no further. Explain why this is the case and where you expect this point to occur.\n",
    "1. We empirically demonstrated convergence to the mean for the toss of a coin. Calculate the variance of the estimate of the probability that we see a head after drawing $n$ samples.\n",
    "    1. How does the variance scale with the number of observations?\n",
    "    1. Use Chebyshev's inequality to bound the deviation from the expectation.\n",
    "    1. How does it relate to the central limit theorem?\n",
    "1. Assume that we draw $m$ samples $x_i$ from a probability distribution with zero mean and unit variance. Compute the averages $z_m \\stackrel{\\textrm{def}}{=} m^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^m x_i$. Can we apply Chebyshev's inequality for every $z_m$ independently? Why not?\n",
    "1. Given two events with probability $P(\\mathcal{A})$ and $P(\\mathcal{B})$, compute upper and lower bounds on $P(\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B})$ and $P(\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{B})$. Hint: graph the situation using a [Venn diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram).\n",
    "1. Assume that we have a sequence of random variables, say $A$, $B$, and $C$, where $B$ only depends on $A$, and $C$ only depends on $B$, can you simplify the joint probability $P(A, B, C)$? Hint: this is a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).\n",
    "1. In :numref:`subsec_probability_hiv_app`, assume that the outcomes of the two tests are not independent. In particular assume that either test on its own has a false positive rate of 10% and a false negative rate of 1%. That is, assume that $P(D =1 \\mid H=0) = 0.1$ and that $P(D = 0 \\mid H=1) = 0.01$. Moreover, assume that for $H = 1$ (infected) the test outcomes are conditionally independent, i.e., that $P(D_1, D_2 \\mid H=1) = P(D_1 \\mid H=1) P(D_2 \\mid H=1)$ but that for healthy patients the outcomes are coupled via $P(D_1 = D_2 = 1 \\mid H=0) = 0.02$.\n",
    "    1. Work out the joint probability table for $D_1$ and $D_2$, given $H=0$ based on the information you have so far.\n",
    "    1. Derive the probability that the patient is diseased ($H=1$) after one test returns positive. You can assume the same baseline probability $P(H=1) = 0.0015$ as before.\n",
    "    1. Derive the probability that the patient is diseased ($H=1$) after both tests return positive.\n",
    "1. Assume that you are an asset manager for an investment bank and you have a choice of stocks $s_i$ to invest in. Your portfolio needs to add up to $1$ with weights $\\alpha_i$ for each stock. The stocks have an average return $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = E_{\\mathbf{s} \\sim P}[\\mathbf{s}]$ and covariance $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\textrm{Cov}_{\\mathbf{s} \\sim P}[\\mathbf{s}]$.\n",
    "    1. Compute the expected return for a given portfolio $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$.\n",
    "    1. If you wanted to maximize the return of the portfolio, how should you choose your investment?\n",
    "    1. Compute the *variance* of the portfolio.\n",
    "    1. Formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the return while keeping the variance constrained to an upper bound. This is the Nobel-Prize winning [Markovitz portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markowitz_model) :cite:`Mangram.2013`. To solve it you will need a quadratic programming solver, something way beyond the scope of this book.\n"
