The image formats in both datasets are PNG, with heights and widths of 32 pixels and three color channels (RGB). The images cover $10$ categories: planes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, boats, and trucks.

Because `lr_period` and `lr_decay` are set to 50 and 0.1 respectively, the learning rate of the optimization algorithm will be multiplied by 0.1 after every 50 epochs.
