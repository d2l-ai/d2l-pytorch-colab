    "* One-dimensional CNNs can process local features such as $n$-grams in text.\n",
    "* Multi-input-channel one-dimensional cross-correlations are equivalent to single-input-channel two-dimensional cross-correlations.\n",
    "* The max-over-time pooling allows different numbers of time steps at different channels.\n",
    "* The textCNN model transforms individual token representations into downstream application outputs using one-dimensional convolutional layers and max-over-time pooling layers.\n",
