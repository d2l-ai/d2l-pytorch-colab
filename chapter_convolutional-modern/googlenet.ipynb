    "\n",
    "In 2014, *GoogLeNet*\n",
    "won the ImageNet Challenge, proposing a structure\n",
    "that combined the strengths of NiN and  paradigms of repeated blocks :cite:`Szegedy.Liu.Jia.ea.2015`.\n",
    "One focus of the paper was to address the question\n",
    "of which sized convolution kernels are best.\n",
    "After all, previous popular networks employed choices\n",
    "as small as $1 \\times 1$ and as large as $11 \\times 11$.\n",
    "One insight in this paper was that sometimes\n",
    "it can be advantageous to employ a combination of variously-sized kernels.\n",
    "In this section, we will introduce GoogLeNet,\n",
    "presenting a slightly simplified version of the original model:\n",

    "to extract information from different spatial sizes.\n",
    "The middle two paths perform a $1\\times 1$ convolution on the input\n",
    "to reduce the number of channels, reducing the model's complexity.\n",
    "The fourth path uses a $3\\times 3$ maximum pooling layer,\n",
    "followed by a $1\\times 1$ convolutional layer\n",
    "to change the number of channels.\n",
    "The four paths all use appropriate padding to give the input and output the same height and width.\n",
    "Finally, the outputs along each path are concatenated\n",
    "along the channel dimension and comprise the block's output.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Inception block is equivalent to a subnetwork with four paths. It extracts information in parallel through convolutional layers of different window shapes and maximum pooling layers. $1 \\times 1$ convolutions reduce channel dimensionality on a per-pixel level. Maximum pooling reduces the resolution.\n",
    "* GoogLeNet connects multiple well-designed Inception blocks with other layers in series. The ratio of the number of channels assigned in the Inception block is obtained through a large number of experiments on the ImageNet dataset.\n",
    "* GoogLeNet, as well as its succeeding versions, was one of the most efficient models on ImageNet, providing similar test accuracy with lower computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are several iterations of GoogLeNet. Try to implement and run them. Some of them include the following:\n",
    "    * Add a batch normalization layer :cite:`Ioffe.Szegedy.2015`, as described\n",
    "      later in :numref:`sec_batch_norm`.\n",
    "    * Make adjustments to the Inception block\n",
    "      :cite:`Szegedy.Vanhoucke.Ioffe.ea.2016`.\n",
    "    * Use label smoothing for model regularization\n",
    "      :cite:`Szegedy.Vanhoucke.Ioffe.ea.2016`.\n",
    "    * Include it in the residual connection\n",
    "      :cite:`Szegedy.Ioffe.Vanhoucke.ea.2017`, as described later in\n",
    "      :numref:`sec_resnet`.\n",
    "1. What is the minimum image size for GoogLeNet to work?\n",
    "1. Compare the model parameter sizes of AlexNet, VGG, and NiN with GoogLeNet. How do the latter two network architectures significantly reduce the model parameter size?\n"
