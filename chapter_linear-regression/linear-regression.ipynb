    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "*Linear regression* is both the simplest\n",
    "and most popular among the standard tools\n",
    "for tackling regression problems.\n",
    "Dating back to the dawn of the 19th century :cite:`Legendre.1805,Gauss.1809`,\n",
    "linear regression flows from a few simple assumptions.\n",
    "First, we assume that the relationship\n",
    "between features $\\mathbf{x}$ and target $y$\n",
    "is approximately linear,\n",
    "i.e., that the conditional mean $E[Y \\mid X=\\mathbf{x}]$\n",
    "can be expressed as a weighted sum\n",
    "of the features $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "This setup allows that the target value\n",
    "may still deviate from its expected value\n",
    "on account of observation noise.\n",
    "Next, we can impose the assumption that any such noise\n",
    "is well behaved, following a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "Typically, we will use $n$ to denote\n",
    "the number of examples in our dataset.\n",
    "We use superscripts to enumerate samples and targets,\n",
    "and subscripts to index coordinates.\n",
    "More concretely,\n",
    "$\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ denotes the $i^{\\textrm{th}}$ sample\n",
    "and $x_j^{(i)}$ denotes its $j^{\\textrm{th}}$ coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    ":label:`subsec_linear_model`\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of every solution is a model\n",
    "that describes how features can be transformed\n",
    "into an estimate of the target.\n",
    "The assumption of linearity means that\n",
    "the expected value of the target (price) can be expressed\n",
    "as a weighted sum of the features (area and age):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{price} = w_{\\textrm{area}} \\cdot \\textrm{area} + w_{\\textrm{age}} \\cdot \\textrm{age} + b.$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_price-area`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $w_{\\textrm{area}}$ and $w_{\\textrm{age}}$\n",
    "are called *weights*, and $b$ is called a *bias*\n",
    "(or *offset* or *intercept*).\n",
    "The weights determine the influence of each feature on our prediction.\n",
    "The bias determines the value of the estimate when all features are zero.\n",
    "Even though we will never see any newly-built homes with precisely zero area,\n",
    "we still need the bias because it allows us\n",
    "to express all linear functions of our features\n",
    "(rather than restricting us to lines that pass through the origin).\n",
    "Strictly speaking, :eqref:`eq_price-area` is an *affine transformation* of input features, which is characterized by a *linear transformation* of features via a weighted sum, combined with a *translation* via the added bias.\n",
    "Given a dataset, our goal is to choose\n",
    "the weights $\\mathbf{w}$ and the bias $b$\n",
    "that, on average, make our model's predictions\n",
    "fit the true prices observed in the data as closely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In disciplines where it is common to focus\n",
    "on datasets with just a few features,\n",
    "explicitly expressing models long-form,\n",
    "as in :eqref:`eq_price-area`, is common.\n",
    "In machine learning, we usually work\n",
    "with high-dimensional datasets,\n",
    "where it is more convenient to employ\n",
    "compact linear algebra notation.\n",
    "When our inputs consist of $d$ features,\n",
    "we can assign each an index (between $1$ and $d$)\n",
    "and express our prediction $\\hat{y}$\n",
    "(in general the \"hat\" symbol denotes an estimate) as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = w_1  x_1 + \\cdots + w_d  x_d + b.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting all features into a vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$\n",
    "and all weights into a vector $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$,\n",
    "we can express our model compactly via the dot product\n",
    "between $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbf{x}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x} + b.$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_linreg-y`\n",

    "In :eqref:`eq_linreg-y`, the vector $\\mathbf{x}$\n",
    "corresponds to the features of a single example.\n",
    "We will often find it convenient\n",
    "to refer to features of our entire dataset of $n$ examples\n",
    "via the *design matrix* $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$.\n",
    "Here, $\\mathbf{X}$ contains one row for every example\n",
    "and one column for every feature.\n",
    "For a collection of features $\\mathbf{X}$,\n",
    "the predictions $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$\n",
    "can be expressed via the matrix--vector product:\n",

    ":eqlabel:`eq_linreg-y-vec`\n",
    "\n",
    "where broadcasting (:numref:`subsec_broadcasting`) is applied during the summation.\n",
    "Given features of a training dataset $\\mathbf{X}$\n",
    "and corresponding (known) labels $\\mathbf{y}$,\n",
    "the goal of linear regression is to find\n",
    "the weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ and the bias term $b$\n",
    "such that, given features of a new data example\n",
    "sampled from the same distribution as $\\mathbf{X}$,\n",
    "the new example's label will (in expectation)\n",
    "be predicted with the smallest error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we believe that the best model for\n",
    "predicting $y$ given $\\mathbf{x}$ is linear,\n",
    "we would not expect to find a real-world dataset of $n$ examples where\n",
    "$y^{(i)}$ exactly equals $\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}^{(i)}+b$\n",
    "for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n",
    "For example, whatever instruments we use to observe\n",
    "the features $\\mathbf{X}$ and labels $\\mathbf{y}$, there might be a small amount of measurement error.\n",
    "Thus, even when we are confident\n",
    "that the underlying relationship is linear,\n",
    "we will incorporate a noise term to account for such errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can go about searching for the best *parameters*\n",
    "(or *model parameters*) $\\mathbf{w}$ and $b$,\n",
    "we will need two more things:\n",
    "(i) a measure of the quality of some given model;\n",
    "and (ii) a procedure for updating the model to improve its quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    ":label:`subsec_linear-regression-loss-function`\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, fitting our model to the data requires\n",
    "that we agree on some measure of *fitness*\n",
    "(or, equivalently, of *unfitness*).\n",
    "*Loss functions* quantify the distance\n",
    "between the *real* and *predicted* values of the target.\n",
    "The loss will usually be a nonnegative number\n",
    "where smaller values are better\n",
    "and perfect predictions incur a loss of 0.\n",
    "For regression problems, the most common loss function is the squared error.\n",
    "When our prediction for an example $i$ is $\\hat{y}^{(i)}$\n",
    "and the corresponding true label is $y^{(i)}$,\n",
    "the *squared error* is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w}, b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\\right)^2.$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_mse`\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant $\\frac{1}{2}$ makes no real difference\n",
    "but proves to be notationally convenient,\n",
    "since it cancels out when we take the derivative of the loss.\n",
    "Because the training dataset is given to us,\n",
    "and thus is out of our control,\n",
    "the empirical error is only a function of the model parameters.\n",
    "In :numref:`fig_fit_linreg`, we visualize the fit of a linear regression model\n",
    "in a problem with one-dimensional inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fitting a linear regression model to one-dimensional data.](../img/fit-linreg.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_fit_linreg`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that large differences between\n",
    "estimates $\\hat{y}^{(i)}$ and targets $y^{(i)}$\n",
    "lead to even larger contributions to the loss,\n",
    "due to its quadratic form\n",
    "(this quadraticity can be a double-edge sword; while it encourages the model to avoid large errors\n",
    "it can also lead to excessive sensitivity to anomalous data).\n",
    "To measure the quality of a model on the entire dataset of $n$ examples,\n",
    "we simply average (or equivalently, sum)\n",
    "the losses on the training set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(\\mathbf{w}, b) =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n l^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w}, b) =\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)}\\right)^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When training the model, we seek parameters ($\\mathbf{w}^*, b^*$)\n",
    "that minimize the total loss across all training examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w}^*, b^* = \\operatorname*{argmin}_{\\mathbf{w}, b}\\  L(\\mathbf{w}, b).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytic Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most of the models that we will cover,\n",
    "linear regression presents us with\n",
    "a surprisingly easy optimization problem.\n",
    "In particular, we can find the optimal parameters\n",
    "(as assessed on the training data)\n",
    "analytically by applying a simple formula as follows.\n",
    "First, we can subsume the bias $b$ into the parameter $\\mathbf{w}$\n",
    "by appending a column to the design matrix consisting of all 1s.\n",
    "Then our prediction problem is to minimize $\\|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}\\|^2$.\n",
    "As long as the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ has full rank\n",
    "(no feature is linearly dependent on the others),\n",
    "then there will be just one critical point on the loss surface\n",
    "and it corresponds to the minimum of the loss over the entire domain.\n",
    "Taking the derivative of the loss with respect to $\\mathbf{w}$\n",
    "and setting it equal to zero yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\partial_{\\mathbf{w}} \\|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}\\|^2 =\n",
    "    2 \\mathbf{X}^\\top (\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{y}) = 0\n",
    "    \\textrm{ and hence }\n",
    "    \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w}.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $\\mathbf{w}$ provides us with the optimal solution\n",
    "for the optimization problem.\n",
    "Note that this solution \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w}^* = (\\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf X)^{-1}\\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "will only be unique\n",
    "when the matrix $\\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf X$ is invertible,\n",
    "i.e., when the columns of the design matrix\n",
    "are linearly independent :cite:`Golub.Van-Loan.1996`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While simple problems like linear regression\n",
    "may admit analytic solutions,\n",
    "you should not get used to such good fortune.\n",
    "Although analytic solutions allow for nice mathematical analysis,\n",
    "the requirement of an analytic solution is so restrictive\n",
    "that it would exclude almost all exciting aspects of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, even in cases where we cannot solve the models analytically,\n",
    "we can still often train models effectively in practice.\n",
    "Moreover, for many tasks, those hard-to-optimize models\n",
    "turn out to be so much better that figuring out how to train them\n",
    "ends up being well worth the trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key technique for optimizing nearly every deep learning model,\n",
    "and which we will call upon throughout this book,\n",
    "consists of iteratively reducing the error\n",
    "by updating the parameters in the direction\n",
    "that incrementally lowers the loss function.\n",
    "This algorithm is called *gradient descent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most naive application of gradient descent\n",
    "consists of taking the derivative of the loss function,\n",
    "which is an average of the losses computed\n",
    "on every single example in the dataset.\n",
    "In practice, this can be extremely slow:\n",
    "we must pass over the entire dataset before making a single update,\n",
    "even if the update steps might be very powerful :cite:`Liu.Nocedal.1989`.\n",
    "Even worse, if there is a lot of redundancy in the training data,\n",
    "the benefit of a full update is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other extreme is to consider only a single example at a time and to take\n",
    "update steps based on one observation at a time.\n",
    "The resulting algorithm, *stochastic gradient descent* (SGD)\n",
    "can be an effective strategy :cite:`Bottou.2010`, even for large datasets.\n",
    "Unfortunately, SGD has drawbacks, both computational and statistical.\n",
    "One problem arises from the fact that processors are a lot faster\n",
    "multiplying and adding numbers than they are\n",
    "at moving data from main memory to processor cache.\n",
    "It is up to an order of magnitude more efficient to\n",
    "perform a matrix--vector multiplication\n",
    "than a corresponding number of vector--vector operations.\n",
    "This means that it can take a lot longer to process\n",
    "one sample at a time compared to a full batch.\n",
    "A second problem is that some of the layers,\n",
    "such as batch normalization (to be described in :numref:`sec_batch_norm`),\n",
    "only work well when we have access\n",
    "to more than one observation at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to both problems is to pick an intermediate strategy:\n",
    "rather than taking a full batch or only a single sample at a time,\n",
    "we take a *minibatch* of observations :cite:`Li.Zhang.Chen.ea.2014`.\n",
    "The specific choice of the size of the said minibatch depends on many factors,\n",
    "such as the amount of memory, the number of accelerators,\n",
    "the choice of layers, and the total dataset size.\n",
    "Despite all that, a number between 32 and 256,\n",
    "preferably a multiple of a large power of $2$, is a good start.\n",
    "This leads us to *minibatch stochastic gradient descent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its most basic form, in each iteration $t$,\n",
    "we first randomly sample a minibatch $\\mathcal{B}_t$\n",
    "consisting of a fixed number $|\\mathcal{B}|$ of training examples.\n",
    "We then compute the derivative (gradient) of the average loss\n",
    "on the minibatch with respect to the model parameters.\n",
    "Finally, we multiply the gradient\n",
    "by a predetermined small positive value $\\eta$,\n",
    "called the *learning rate*,\n",
    "and subtract the resulting term from the current parameter values.\n",
    "We can express the update as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\mathbf{w},b) \\leftarrow (\\mathbf{w},b) - \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}_t} \\partial_{(\\mathbf{w},b)} l^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w},b).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, minibatch SGD proceeds as follows:\n",
    "(i) initialize the values of the model parameters, typically at random;\n",
    "(ii) iteratively sample random minibatches from the data,\n",
    "updating the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.\n",
    "For quadratic losses and affine transformations,\n",
    "this has a closed-form expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{w} & \\leftarrow \\mathbf{w} - \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}_t} \\partial_{\\mathbf{w}} l^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w}, b) && = \\mathbf{w} - \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}_t} \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} \\left(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)}\\right)\\\\ b &\\leftarrow b -  \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}_t} \\partial_b l^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w}, b) &&  = b - \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}_t} \\left(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)}\\right). \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_linreg_batch_update`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we pick a minibatch $\\mathcal{B}$\n",
    "we need to normalize by its size $|\\mathcal{B}|$.\n",
    "Frequently minibatch size and learning rate are user-defined.\n",
    "Such tunable parameters that are not updated\n",
    "in the training loop are called *hyperparameters*.\n",
    "They can be tuned automatically by a number of techniques, such as Bayesian optimization\n",
    ":cite:`Frazier.2018`. In the end, the quality of the solution is\n",
    "typically assessed on a separate *validation dataset* (or *validation set*).\n",
    "\n",
    "After training for some predetermined number of iterations\n",
    "(or until some other stopping criterion is met),\n",
    "we record the estimated model parameters,\n",
    "denoted $\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}, \\hat{b}$.\n",
    "Note that even if our function is truly linear and noiseless,\n",
    "these parameters will not be the exact minimizers of the loss, nor even deterministic.\n",
    "Although the algorithm converges slowly towards the minimizers\n",
    "it typically will not find them exactly in a finite number of steps.\n",
    "Moreover, the minibatches $\\mathcal{B}$\n",
    "used for updating the parameters are chosen at random.\n",
    "This breaks determinism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression happens to be a learning problem\n",
    "with a global minimum\n",
    "(whenever $\\mathbf{X}$ is full rank, or equivalently,\n",
    "whenever $\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X}$ is invertible).\n",
    "However, the loss surfaces for deep networks contain many saddle points and minima.\n",
    "Fortunately, we typically do not care about finding\n",
    "an exact set of parameters but merely any set of parameters\n",
    "that leads to accurate predictions (and thus low loss).\n",
    "In practice, deep learning practitioners\n",
    "seldom struggle to find parameters\n",
    "that minimize the loss *on training sets*\n",
    ":cite:`Izmailov.Podoprikhin.Garipov.ea.2018,Frankle.Carbin.2018`.\n",
    "The more formidable task is to find parameters\n",
    "that lead to accurate predictions on previously unseen data,\n",
    "a challenge called *generalization*.\n",
    "We return to these topics throughout the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the model $\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}^\\top \\mathbf{x} + \\hat{b}$,\n",
    "we can now make *predictions* for a new example,\n",
    "e.g., predicting the sales price of a previously unseen house\n",
    "given its area $x_1$ and age $x_2$.\n",
    "Deep learning practitioners have taken to calling the prediction phase *inference*\n",
    "but this is a bit of a misnomer---*inference* refers broadly\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we introduced\n",
    "traditional linear regression,\n",
    "where the parameters of a linear function\n",
    "are chosen to minimize squared loss on the training set.\n",
    "We also motivated this choice of objective\n",
    "both via some practical considerations\n",
    "and through an interpretation\n",
    "of linear regression as maximimum likelihood estimation\n",
    "under an assumption of linearity and Gaussian noise.\n",
    "After discussing both computational considerations\n",
    "and connections to statistics,\n",
    "we showed how such linear models could be expressed\n",
    "as simple neural networks where the inputs\n",
    "are directly wired to the output(s).\n",
    "While we will soon move past linear models altogether,\n",
    "they are sufficient to introduce most of the components\n",
    "that all of our models require:\n",
    "parametric forms, differentiable objectives,\n",
    "optimization via minibatch stochastic gradient descent,\n",
    "and ultimately, evaluation on previously unseen data.\n",

    "1. Prove that the affine functions that can be expressed by $\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{w} + b$ are equivalent to linear functions on $(\\mathbf{x}, 1)$.\n",
    "1. Assume that you want to find quadratic functions of $\\mathbf{x}$, i.e., $f(\\mathbf{x}) = b + \\sum_i w_i x_i + \\sum_{j \\leq i} w_{ij} x_{i} x_{j}$. How would you formulate this in a deep network?\n",
    "1. Recall that one of the conditions for the linear regression problem to be solvable was that the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X}$ has full rank.\n",
    "    1. What happens if this is not the case?\n",
    "    1. How could you fix it? What happens if you add a small amount of coordinate-wise independent Gaussian noise to all entries of $\\mathbf{X}$?\n",
    "    1. What is the expected value of the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X}$ in this case?\n",
    "    1. What happens with stochastic gradient descent when $\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X}$ does not have full rank?\n",
    "1. Assume that the noise model governing the additive noise $\\epsilon$ is the exponential distribution. That is, $p(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(-|\\epsilon|)$.\n",
    "    1. Write out the negative log-likelihood of the data under the model $-\\log P(\\mathbf y \\mid \\mathbf X)$.\n",

    "    1. Suggest a minibatch stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve this problem. What could possibly go wrong (hint: what happens near the stationary point as we keep on updating the parameters)? Can you fix this?\n",
    "1. Assume that we want to design a neural network with two layers by composing two linear layers. That is, the output of the first layer becomes the input of the second layer. Why would such a naive composition not work?\n",
