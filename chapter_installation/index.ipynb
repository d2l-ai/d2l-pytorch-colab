    "## Installing Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to get going will be to install\n",
    "[Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). \n",
    "The Python 3.x version is required. \n",
    "You can skip the following steps \n",
    "if your machine already has conda installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit the Miniconda website and determine \n",
    "the appropriate version for your system\n",
    "based on your Python 3.x version and machine architecture.\n",
    "For example, if you are using macOS and Python 3.x \n",
    "you would download the bash script \n",
    "whose name contains the strings \"Miniconda3\" and \"MacOSX\",\n",
    "navigate to the download location,\n",
    "and execute the installation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A Linux user with Python 3.x \n",
    "would download the file\n",
    "whose name contains the strings \"Miniconda3\" and \"Linux\" \n",
    "and execute the following at the download location:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b\n",
    "```\n",
