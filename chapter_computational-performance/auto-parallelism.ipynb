    "Deep learning frameworks (e.g., MXNet and PyTorch) automatically construct computational graphs at the backend. Using a\n",
    "computational graph, the system is aware of all the dependencies,\n",
    "and can selectively execute multiple non-interdependent tasks in parallel to\n",
    "improve speed. For instance, :numref:`fig_asyncgraph` in :numref:`sec_async` initializes two variables independently. Consequently the system can choose to execute them in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a single operator will use all the computational resources on all CPUs or on a single GPU. For example, the `dot` operator will use all cores (and threads) on all CPUs, even if there are multiple CPU processors on a single machine. The same applies to a single GPU. Hence parallelization is not quite so useful for single-device computers. With multiple devices things matter more. While parallelization is typically most relevant between multiple GPUs, adding the local CPU will increase performance slightly. For example, see :citet:`Hadjis.Zhang.Mitliagkas.ea.2016` that focuses on training computer vision models combining a GPU and a CPU. With the convenience of an automatically parallelizing framework we can accomplish the same goal in a few lines of Python code. More broadly, our discussion of automatic parallel computation focuses on parallel computation using both CPUs and GPUs, as well as the parallelization of computation and communication.\n",

    "This is somewhat inefficient. Note that we could already start copying parts of `y` to the CPU while the remainder of the list is still being computed. This situation occurs, e.g., when we compute the (backprop) gradient on a minibatch. The gradients of some of the parameters will be available earlier than that of others. Hence it works to our advantage to start using PCI-Express bus bandwidth while the GPU is still running. In PyTorch, several functions such as `to()` and `copy_()` admit an explicit `non_blocking` argument, which lets the caller bypass synchronization when it is unnecessary. Setting `non_blocking=True` allows us to simulate this scenario.\n"

    "* Modern systems have a variety of devices, such as multiple GPUs and CPUs. They can be used in parallel, asynchronously.\n",
    "* Modern systems also have a variety of resources for communication, such as PCI Express, storage (typically solid-state drives or via networks), and network bandwidth. They can be used in parallel for peak efficiency.\n",

    "1. Eight operations were performed in the `run` function defined in this section. There are no dependencies between them. Design an experiment to see if the deep learning framework will automatically execute them in parallel.\n",
    "1. When the workload of an individual operator is sufficiently small, parallelization can help even on a single CPU or GPU. Design an experiment to verify this.\n",
    "1. Design an experiment that uses parallel computation on CPUs, GPUs, and communication between both devices.\n",
    "1. Use a debugger such as NVIDIA's [Nsight](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute-2019_5) to verify that your code is efficient.\n",
    "1. Designing computation tasks that include more complex data dependencies, and run experiments to see if you can obtain the correct results while improving performance.\n"
