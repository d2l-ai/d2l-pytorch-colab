    "So far, our working example of a sequence learning task has been language modeling,\n",
    "where we aim to predict the next token given all previous tokens in a sequence. \n",
    "In this scenario, we wish only to condition upon the leftward context,\n",
    "and thus the unidirectional chaining of a standard RNN seems appropriate. \n",
    "However, there are many other sequence learning tasks contexts \n",
    "where it is perfectly fine to condition the prediction at every time step\n",
    "on both the leftward and the rightward context. \n",
    "Consider, for example, part of speech detection. \n",
    "Why shouldn't we take the context in both directions into account\n",
    "when assessing the part of speech associated with a given word?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common task---often useful as a pretraining exercise\n",
    "prior to fine-tuning a model on an actual task of interest---is\n",
    "to mask out random tokens in a text document and then to train \n",
    "a sequence model to predict the values of the missing tokens.\n",
    "Note that depending on what comes after the blank,\n",
    "the likely value of the missing token changes dramatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I am `___`.\n",
    "* I am `___` hungry.\n",
    "* I am `___` hungry, and I can eat half a pig.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first sentence \"happy\" seems to be a likely candidate.\n",

    "In bidirectional RNNs, the hidden state for each time step is simultaneously determined by the data prior to and after the current time step. Bidirectional RNNs are mostly useful for sequence encoding and the estimation of observations given bidirectional context. Bidirectional RNNs are very costly to train due to long gradient chains.\n",

    "1. Polysemy is common in natural languages. For example, the word \"bank\" has different meanings in contexts “i went to the bank to deposit cash” and “i went to the bank to sit down”. How can we design a neural network model such that given a context sequence and a word, a vector representation of the word in the context will be returned? What type of neural architectures is preferred for handling polysemy?\n"
