    ":numref:`fig_r-cnn` shows the R-CNN model. More concretely, the R-CNN consists of the following four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform *selective search* to extract multiple high-quality region proposals on the input image :cite:`Uijlings.Van-De-Sande.Gevers.ea.2013`. These proposed regions are usually selected at multiple scales with different shapes and sizes. Each region proposal will be labeled with a class and a ground-truth bounding box.\n",
    "1. Choose a pretrained CNN and truncate it before the output layer. Resize each region proposal to the input size required by the network, and output the extracted features for the region proposal through forward propagation.\n",
    "1. Take the extracted features and labeled class of each region proposal as an example. Train multiple support vector machines to classify objects, where each support vector machine individually determines whether the example contains a specific class.\n",
    "1. Take the extracted features and labeled bounding box of each region proposal as an example. Train a linear regression model to predict the ground-truth bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the R-CNN model uses pretrained CNNs to effectively extract image features,\n",
    "it is slow.\n",
    "Imagine that we select\n",
    "thousands of region proposals from a single input image:\n",
    "this requires thousands of\n",
    "CNN forward propagations to perform object detection.\n",
    "This massive\n",
    "computing load makes it infeasible to\n",
    "widely use R-CNNs in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fast R-CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "The main performance bottleneck of\n",
    "an R-CNN lies in\n",
    "the independent CNN forward propagation\n",
    "for each region proposal,\n",
    "without sharing computation.\n",
    "Since these regions usually have\n",
    "overlaps,\n",
    "independent feature extractions lead to\n",
    "much repeated computation.\n",
    "One of the major improvements of\n",
    "the *fast R-CNN* from the\n",
    "R-CNN is that\n",
    "the CNN forward propagation\n",
    "is only performed on\n",
    "the entire image :cite:`Girshick.2015`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The fast R-CNN model.](../img/fast-rcnn.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_fast_r-cnn`\n",
    "\n",
    ":numref:`fig_fast_r-cnn` describes the fast R-CNN model. Its major computations are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compared with the R-CNN, in the fast R-CNN the input of the CNN for feature extraction is the entire image, rather than individual region proposals. Moreover, this CNN is trainable. Given an input image, let the shape of the CNN output be $1 \\times c \\times h_1  \\times w_1$.\n",
    "1. Suppose that selective search generates $n$ region proposals. These region proposals (of different shapes) mark regions of interest (of different shapes) on the CNN output. Then these regions of interest further extract features of the same shape (say height $h_2$ and width $w_2$ are specified) in order to be easily concatenated. To achieve this, the fast R-CNN introduces the *region of interest (RoI) pooling* layer: the CNN output and region proposals are input into this layer, outputting concatenated features of shape $n \\times c \\times h_2 \\times w_2$ that are further extracted for all the region proposals.\n",
    "1. Using a fully connected layer, transform the concatenated features into an output of shape $n \\times d$, where $d$ depends on the model design.\n",
    "1. Predict the class and bounding box for each of the $n$ region proposals. More concretely, in class and bounding box prediction, transform the fully connected layer output into an output of shape $n \\times q$ ($q$ is the number of classes) and an output of shape $n \\times 4$, respectively. The class prediction uses softmax regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The region of interest pooling layer proposed in the fast R-CNN is different from the pooling layer introduced in :numref:`sec_pooling`.\n",
    "In the pooling layer,\n",
    "we indirectly control the output shape\n",
    "by specifying sizes of\n",
    "the pooling window, padding, and stride.\n",
    "In contrast,\n",
    "we can directly specify the output shape\n",
    "in the region of interest pooling layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's specify\n",
    "the output height and width\n",
    "for each region as $h_2$ and $w_2$, respectively.\n",
    "For any region of interest window\n",
    "of shape $h \\times w$,\n",
    "this window is divided into a $h_2 \\times w_2$ grid\n",
    "of subwindows,\n",
    "where the shape of each subwindow is approximately\n",
    "$(h/h_2) \\times (w/w_2)$.\n",
    "In practice,\n",
    "the height and width of any subwindow shall be rounded up, and the largest element shall be used as output of the subwindow.\n",
    "Therefore, the region of interest pooling layer can extract features of the same shape\n",
    "even when regions of interest have different shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustrative example,\n",
    "in :numref:`fig_roi`,\n",
    "the upper-left $3\\times 3$ region of interest\n",
    "is selected on a $4 \\times 4$ input.\n",
    "For this region of interest,\n",
    "we use a $2\\times 2$ region of interest pooling layer to obtain\n",
    "a $2\\times 2$ output.\n",
    "Note that\n",
    "each of the four divided subwindows\n",
    "contains elements\n",
    "0, 1, 4, and 5 (5 is the maximum);\n",
    "2 and 6 (6 is the maximum);\n",
    "8 and 9 (9 is the maximum);\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The R-CNN extracts many region proposals from the input image, uses a CNN to perform forward propagation on each region proposal to extract its features, then uses these features to predict the class and bounding box of this region proposal.\n",
    "* One of the major improvements of  the fast R-CNN from the R-CNN is that the CNN forward propagation is only performed on  the entire image. It also introduces the region of interest pooling layer, so that features of the same shape can be further extracted for regions of interest that have different shapes.\n",
    "* The faster R-CNN replaces the selective search used in the fast R-CNN with a jointly trained region proposal network, so that the former can stay accurate in object detection with a reduced number of region proposals.\n",
    "* Based on the faster R-CNN, the mask R-CNN additionally introduces a fully convolutional network, so as to leverage pixel-level labels to further improve the accuracy of object detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can we frame object detection as a single regression problem, such as predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities? You may refer to the design of the YOLO model :cite:`Redmon.Divvala.Girshick.ea.2016`.\n",
    "1. Compare single shot multibox detection with the methods introduced in this section. What are their major differences? You may refer to Figure 2 of :citet:`Zhao.Zheng.Xu.ea.2019`.\n"
