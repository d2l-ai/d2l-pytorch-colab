    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Data loaders are a convenient way of abstracting out \n",
    "the process of loading and manipulating data. \n",
    "This way the same machine learning *algorithm* \n",
    "is capable of processing many different types and sources of data \n",
    "without the need for modification. \n",
    "One of the nice things about data loaders \n",
    "is that they can be composed. \n",
    "For instance, we might be loading images \n",
    "and then have a post-processing filter \n",
    "that crops them or modifies them otherwise. \n",
    "As such, data loaders can be used \n",
    "to describe an entire data processing pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the model itself, the two-dimensional linear model \n",
    "is about as simple a model as we might encounter. \n",
    "It lets us test out the accuracy of regression models \n",
    "without worry about having insufficient amounts of data \n",
    "or an underdetermined system of equations. \n",
    "We will put this to good use in the next section.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What will happen if the number of examples cannot be divided by the batch size. How to change this behavior by specifying a different argument by using framework's API?\n",
    "1. What if we want to generate a huge dataset, where both the size of the parameter vector `w` and the number of examples `num_examples` are large? \n",
    "    1. What happens if we cannot hold all data in memory?\n",
    "    1. How would you shuffle the data if data is held on disk? Your task is to design an *efficient* algorithm that does not require too many random reads or writes. Hint: [pseudorandom permutation generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_permutation) allow you to design a reshuffle without the need to store the permutation table explicitly :cite:`Naor.Reingold.1999`. \n",
    "1. Implement a data generator that produces new data on the fly, every time the iterator is called. \n",
    "1. How would you design a random data generator that generates *the same* data each time it's called?\n"
