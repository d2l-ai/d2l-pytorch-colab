This should sound familiar if you have ever used spreadsheet software or have read :numref:`sec_pandas`. Thus, although the default orientation of a single vector is a column vector, in a matrix that represents a tabular dataset, it is more conventional to treat each data point as a row vector in the matrix. And, as we will see in later chapters, this convention will enable common deep learning practices. For example, along the outermost axis of a tensor, we can access or enumerate minibatches of data points, or just data points if no minibatch exists.\n",

    "\n",
    "Through :numref:`sec_linear-algebra` and the above discussions, \n",
    "we have a solid understanding of the geometry of vectors, lengths, and angles. \n",
    "However, there is one important object we have omitted discussing, \n",
    "and that is a geometric understanding of linear transformations represented by matrices.  Fully internalizing what matrices can do to transform data \n",
    "between two potentially different high dimensional spaces takes significant practice,\n",
    "and is beyond the scope of this appendix. \n",
    "However, we can start building up intuition in two dimensions.\n",

    "Let us take $\\mathbf{b}_1 = [2,4]^\\top$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2 = [-1, -2]^\\top$ \n",
    "be the two columns of $\\mathbf{B}$.\n",
    "Remember that we can write everything transformed by the matrix $\\mathbf{B}$\n",
    "as a weighted sum of the columns of the matrix: \n",
    "like $a_1\\mathbf{b}_1 + a_2\\mathbf{b}_2$.\n",
    "We call this a *linear combination*. \n",
    "The fact that $\\mathbf{b}_1 = -2\\cdot\\mathbf{b}_2$ \n",

    "\n",
    "This means that one of the columns is, in a sense, redundant \n",
    "because it does not define a unique direction in space. \n",
    "This should not surprise us too much \n",
    "since we already saw that this matrix \n",
    "collapses the entire plane down into a single line.\n",

    "* Vectors can be interpreted geometrically as either points or directions in space.\n",
    "* Dot products define the notion of angle to arbitrarily high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "* Hyperplanes are high-dimensional generalizations of lines and planes.  They can be used to define decision planes that are often used as the last step in a classification task.\n",
    "* Matrix multiplication can be geometrically interpreted as uniform distortions of the underlying coordinates. They represent a very restricted, but mathematically clean, way to transform vectors.\n",
    "* Linear dependence is a way to tell when a collection of vectors are in a lower dimensional space than we would expect (say you have $3$ vectors living in a $2$-dimensional space). The rank of a matrix is the size of the largest subset of its columns that are linearly independent.\n",
    "* When a matrix's inverse is defined, matrix inversion allows us to find another matrix that undoes the action of the first. Matrix inversion is useful in theory, but requires care in practice owing to numerical instability.\n",
    "* Determinants allow us to measure how much a matrix expands or contracts a space. A nonzero determinant implies an invertible (non-singular) matrix and a zero-valued determinant means that the matrix is non-invertible (singular).\n",
