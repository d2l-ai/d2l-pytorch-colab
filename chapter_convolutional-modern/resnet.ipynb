    ":label:`sec_resnet`\n",
    "\n",
    "As we design increasingly deeper networks it becomes imperative to understand how adding layers can increase the complexity and expressiveness of the network.\n",
    "Even more important is the ability to design networks where adding layers makes networks strictly more expressive rather than just different.\n",
    "To make some progress we need a bit of mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $\\mathcal{F}$, the class of functions that a specific network architecture (together with learning rates and other hyperparameter settings) can reach.\n",
    "That is, for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ there exists some set of parameters (e.g., weights and biases) that can be obtained through training on a suitable dataset.\n",
    "Let's assume that $f^*$ is the \"truth\" function that we really would like to find.\n",
    "If it is in $\\mathcal{F}$, we are in good shape but typically we will not be quite so lucky.\n",
    "Instead, we will try to find some $f^*_\\mathcal{F}$ which is our best bet within $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "For instance,\n",
    "given a dataset with features $\\mathbf{X}$\n",
    "and labels $\\mathbf{y}$,\n",
    "we might try finding it by solving the following optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f^*_\\mathcal{F} \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=} \\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_f L(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{y}, f) \\text{ subject to } f \\in \\mathcal{F}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that regularization :cite:`tikhonov1977solutions,morozov2012methods` may control complexity of $\\mathcal{F}$\n",
    "and achieve consistency, so a larger size of training data \n",
    "generally leads to better $f^*_\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "It is only reasonable to assume that if we design a different and more powerful architecture $\\mathcal{F}'$ we should arrive at a better outcome. In other words, we would expect that $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}'}$ is \"better\" than $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}}$. However, if $\\mathcal{F} \\not\\subseteq \\mathcal{F}'$ there is no guarantee that this should even happen. In fact, $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}'}$ might well be worse.\n",
    "As illustrated by :numref:`fig_functionclasses`,\n",
    "for non-nested function classes, a larger function class does not always move closer to the \"truth\" function $f^*$. For instance,\n",
    "on the left of :numref:`fig_functionclasses`,\n",
    "though $\\mathcal{F}_3$ is closer to $f^*$ than $\\mathcal{F}_1$, $\\mathcal{F}_6$ moves away and there is no guarantee that further increasing the complexity can reduce the distance from $f^*$.\n",
    "With nested function classes\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{F}_1 \\subseteq \\ldots \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_6$\n",
    "on the right of :numref:`fig_functionclasses`,\n",
    "we can avoid the aforementioned issue from the non-nested function classes.\n",

    ":label:`fig_functionclasses`\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus,\n",
    "only if larger function classes contain the smaller ones are we guaranteed that increasing them strictly increases the expressive power of the network.\n",
    "For deep neural networks,\n",
    "if we can\n",
    "train the newly-added layer into an identity function $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$, the new model will be as effective as the original model. As the new model may get a better solution to fit the training dataset, the added layer might make it easier to reduce training errors.\n",

    "These considerations are rather profound but they led to a surprisingly simple\n",
    "solution, a *residual block*.\n",

Then, we skip these two convolution operations and add the input directly before the final ReLU activation function.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nested function classes are desirable. Learning an additional layer in deep neural networks as an identity function (though this is an extreme case) should be made easy. The residual mapping can learn the identity function more easily, such as pushing parameters in the weight layer to zero. We can train an effective *deep* neural network by having residual blocks. Inputs can forward propagate faster through the residual connections across layers.\n",

    "in areas as diverse as \n",
    "language, vision, speech, and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "A key advantage of the ResNeXt design\n",
    "is that increasing groups\n",
    "leads to sparser connections (i.e., lower computational complexity) within the block,\n",
