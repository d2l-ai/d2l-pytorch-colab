    "a persistent menace that you will confront\n",
    "throughout your career. \n",
    "Depending upon the context, \n",
    "missing values might be handled\n",
    "either via *imputation* or *deletion*.\n",
    "Imputation replaces missing values \n",
    "with estimates of their values\n",
    "while deletion simply discards \n",

    "that contain missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common imputation heuristics.\n",
    "[**For categorical input fields, \n",

    "into two columns `RoofType_Slate` and `RoofType_nan`.\n",

    "For instance, in an e-commerce application,\n",
    "customer addresses might live in one table\n",

    "Moreover, practitioners face myriad data types\n",
    "beyond categorical and numeric. \n",
    "Other data types include text strings, images,\n",
    "audio data, and point clouds. \n",
    "Oftentimes, advanced tools and efficient algorithms \n",
    "are required to prevent data processing from becoming\n",
    "the biggest bottleneck in the machine learning pipeline. \n",
    "These problems will arise when we get to \n",
    "computer vision and natural language processing. \n",
    "Finally, we must pay attention to data quality.\n",
    "Real-world datasets are often plagued \n",
    "by outliers, faulty measurements from sensors, and recording errors, \n",
    "which must be addressed before \n",
    "feeding the data into any model. \n",
    "Data visualization tools such as [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), \n",
    "[Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/), or [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try loading datasets, e.g., Abalone from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) and inspect their properties. What fraction of them has missing values? What fraction of the variables is numerical, categorical, or text?\n",
    "1. Try out indexing and selecting data columns by name rather than by column number. The pandas documentation on [indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html) has further details on how to do this.\n",
    "1. How large a dataset do you think you could load this way? What might be the limitations? Hint: consider the time to read the data, representation, processing, and memory footprint. Try this out on your laptop. What changes if you try it out on a server? \n",
    "1. How would you deal with data that has a very large number of categories? What if the category labels are all unique? Should you include the latter?\n",
    "1. What alternatives to pandas can you think of? How about [loading NumPy tensors from a file](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.load.html)? Check out [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/), the Python Imaging Library.\n"
