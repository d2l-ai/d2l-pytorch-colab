    "## Installing Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to get going will be to install\n",
    "[Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). The Python 3.x version\n",
    "is required. You can skip the following steps if conda has already been installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit the Miniconda website and determine the appropriate version for your system\n",
    "based on your Python 3.x version and machine architecture.\n",
    "For example, if you are using macOS and Python 3.x you would download the \n",
    "bash script with strings \"Miniconda3\" and \"MacOSX\" in its name,\n",
    "navigate to the download location\n",
    "and execute the installation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A Linux user with Python 3.x would download the file\n",
    "with strings \"Miniconda3\" and \"Linux\" in its name \n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b\n",
    "```\n",
