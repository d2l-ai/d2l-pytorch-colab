    "## One-Dimensional Convolutional Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Before introducing the model, let us explain how a one-dimensional convolutional layer works. Like a two-dimensional convolutional layer, a one-dimensional convolutional layer uses a one-dimensional cross-correlation operation. In the one-dimensional cross-correlation operation, the convolution window starts from the leftmost side of the input array and slides on the input array from left to right successively. When the convolution window slides to a certain position, the input subarray in the window and kernel array are multiplied and summed by element to get the element at the corresponding location in the output array. As shown in :numref:`fig_conv1d`, the input is a one-dimensional array with a width of 7 and the width of the kernel array is 2. As we can see, the output width is $7-2+1=6$ and the first element is obtained by performing multiplication by element on the leftmost input subarray with a width of 2 and kernel array and then summing the results.\n",

Assuming that the input contains multiple channels, and each channel consists of values on different time steps, the output of each channel will be the largest value of all time steps in the channel. Therefore, the input of the max-over-time pooling layer can have different time steps on each channel.\n",

Because the main purpose of the max-over-time pooling layer is to capture the most important features of timing, it usually allows the model to be unaffected by the manually added characters.\n",

    "## The TextCNN Model\n",

    "TextCNN mainly uses a one-dimensional convolutional layer and max-over-time pooling layer. Suppose the input text sequence consists of $n$ words, and each word is represented by a $d$-dimension word vector. Then the input example has a width of $n$, a height of 1, and $d$ input channels. The calculation of textCNN can be mainly divided into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define multiple one-dimensional convolution kernels and use them to perform convolution calculations on the inputs. Convolution kernels with different widths may capture the correlation of different numbers of adjacent words.\n",
    "2. Perform max-over-time pooling on all output channels, and then concatenate the pooling output values of these channels in a vector.\n",
    "3. The concatenated vector is transformed into the output for each category through the fully connected layer. A dropout layer can be used in this step to deal with overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    ":numref:`fig_conv1d_textcnn` gives an example to illustrate the textCNN. The input here is a sentence with 11 words, with each word represented by a 6-dimensional word vector. Therefore, the input sequence has a width of 11 and 6 input channels. We assume there are two one-dimensional convolution kernels with widths of 2 and 4, and 4 and 5 output channels, respectively. Therefore, after one-dimensional convolution calculation, the width of the four output channels is $11-2+1=10$, while the width of the other five channels is $11-4+1=8$. Even though the width of each channel is different, we can still perform max-over-time pooling for each channel and concatenate the pooling outputs of the 9 channels into a 9-dimensional vector. Finally, we use a fully connected layer to transform the 9-dimensional vector into a 2-dimensional output: positive sentiment and negative sentiment predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will implement a textCNN model. Compared with the previous section, in addition to replacing the recurrent neural network with a one-dimensional convolutional layer, here we use two embedding layers, one with a fixed weight and another that participates in training.\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can use one-dimensional convolution to process and analyze timing data.\n",
    "* A one-dimensional cross-correlation operation with multiple input channels can be regarded as a two-dimensional cross-correlation operation with a single input channel.\n",
    "* The input of the max-over-time pooling layer can have different numbers of time steps on each channel.\n",
    "* TextCNN mainly uses a one-dimensional convolutional layer and max-over-time pooling layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tune the hyperparameters and compare the two sentiment analysis methods, using recurrent neural networks and using convolutional neural networks, as regards accuracy and operational efficiency.\n",
    "1. Can you further improve the accuracy of the model on the test set by using the three methods introduced in the previous section: tuning hyperparameters, using larger pretrained word vectors, and using the spaCy word tokenization tool?\n",
    "1. What other natural language processing tasks can you use textCNN for?\n",
    "1. Add positional encoding in the input representations. Does it improve the performance?\n"
