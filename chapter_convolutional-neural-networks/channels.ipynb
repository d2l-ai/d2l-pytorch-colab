    "as just a two-dimensional tensor of shape $k_h\\times k_w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when $c_i>1$, we need a kernel\n",

    "yields a convolution kernel of shape $c_i\\times k_h\\times k_w$.\n",
    "Since the input and convolution kernel each have $c_i$ channels,\n",
    "we can perform a cross-correlation operation\n",
    "on the two-dimensional tensor of the input\n",
    "and the two-dimensional tensor of the convolution kernel\n",
    "for each channel, adding the $c_i$ results together\n",
    "(summing over the channels)\n",
