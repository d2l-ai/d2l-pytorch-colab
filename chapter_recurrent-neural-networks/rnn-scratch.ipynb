Therefore, RNN models often need extra help to stabilize the training.\n",

    "While implementing the above RNN model from scratch is instructive, it is not convenient. In the next section we will see how to improve significantly on the current model and how to make it faster and easier to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sequence models need state initialization for training.\n",
    "* Between sequential models you need to ensure to detach the gradients, to ensure that the automatic differentiation does not propagate effects beyond the current sample.\n",
    "* A simple RNN language model consists of an encoder, an RNN model, and a decoder.\n",
    "* Gradient clipping prevents gradient explosion (but it cannot fix vanishing gradients).\n",
    "* Perplexity calibrates model performance across different sequence length. It is the exponentiated average of the cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "* Sequential partitioning typically leads to better models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show that one-hot encoding is equivalent to picking a different embedding for each object.\n",
    "1. Adjust the hyperparameters to improve the perplexity.\n",
    "    * How low can you go? Adjust embeddings, hidden units, learning rate, etc.\n",
    "    * How well will it work on other books by H. G. Wells, e.g., [The War of the Worlds](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36).\n",
    "1. Modify the predict function such as to use sampling rather than picking the most likely next character.\n",
    "    * What happens?\n",
    "    * Bias the model towards more likely outputs, e.g., by sampling from $q(w_t \\mid w_{t-1}, \\ldots, w_1) \\propto p^\\alpha(w_t \\mid w_{t-1}, \\ldots, w_1)$ for $\\alpha > 1$.\n",
    "1. Run the code in this section without clipping the gradient. What happens?\n",
    "1. Change sequential partitioning so that it does not separate hidden states from the computational graph. Does the running time change? How about the accuracy?\n",
    "1. Replace the activation function used in this section with ReLU and repeat the experiments in this section.\n",
    "1. Prove that the perplexity is the inverse of the harmonic mean of the conditional word probabilities.\n"
