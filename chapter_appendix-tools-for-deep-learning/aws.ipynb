    "# Using AWS EC2 Instances\n",
    ":label:`sec_aws`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will show you how to install all libraries on a raw Linux machine. Remember that in :numref:`sec_sagemaker` we discussed how to use Amazon SageMaker, while building an instance by yourself costs less on AWS. The walkthrough includes a number of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Request for a GPU Linux instance from AWS EC2.\n",
    "1. Optionally: install CUDA or use an AMI with CUDA preinstalled.\n",
    "1. Set up the corresponding MXNet GPU version.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process applies to other instances (and other clouds), too, albeit with some minor modifications. Before going forward, you need to create an AWS account, see :numref:`sec_sagemaker` for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating and Running an EC2 Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "After logging into your AWS account, click \"EC2\" (marked by the red box in :numref:`fig_aws`) to go to the EC2 panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Open the EC2 console.](../img/aws.png)\n",
    ":width:`400px`\n",
    ":label:`fig_aws`\n",
    "\n",
    ":numref:`fig_ec2` shows the EC2 panel with sensitive account information greyed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "![EC2 panel.](../img/ec2.png)\n",
    ":width:`700px`\n",
    ":label:`fig_ec2`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Presetting Location\n",
    "Select a nearby data center to reduce latency, e.g., \"Oregon\" (marked by the red box in the top-right of :numref:`fig_ec2`). If you are located in China,\n",
    "you can select a nearby Asia Pacific region, such as Seoul or Tokyo. Please note\n",
    "that some data centers may not have GPU instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Increasing Limits\n",
    "Before choosing an instance, check if there are quantity\n",
    "restrictions by clicking the \"Limits\" label in the bar on the left as shown in\n",
    ":numref:`fig_ec2`. :numref:`fig_limits` shows an example of such a\n",
    "limitation. The account currently cannot open \"p2.xlarge\" instance per region. If\n",
    "you need to open one or more instances, click on the \"Request limit increase\" link to\n",
    "apply for a higher instance quota. Generally, it takes one business day to\n",
    "process an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Instance quantity restrictions.](../img/limits.png)\n",
    ":width:`700px`\n",
    ":label:`fig_limits`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launching Instance\n",
    "Next, click the \"Launch Instance\" button marked by the red box in :numref:`fig_ec2` to launch your instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by selecting a suitable AMI (AWS Machine Image). Enter \"Ubuntu\" in the search box (marked by the red box in :numref:`fig_ubuntu`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Choose an operating system.](../img/ubuntu-new.png)\n",
    ":width:`700px`\n",
    ":label:`fig_ubuntu`\n",
    "\n",
    "EC2 provides many different instance configurations to choose from. This can sometimes feel overwhelming to a beginner. Here's a table of suitable machines:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | GPU         | Notes                         |\n",
    "|------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n",
    "| g2   | Grid K520   | ancient                       |\n",
    "| p2   | Kepler K80  | old but often cheap as spot   |\n",
    "| g3   | Maxwell M60 | good trade-off                |\n",
    "| p3   | Volta V100  | high performance for FP16     |\n",
    "| g4   | Turing T4   | inference optimized FP16/INT8 |\n",
    "\n",
    "All the above servers come in multiple flavors indicating the number of GPUs used. For example, a p2.xlarge has 1 GPU and a p2.16xlarge has 16 GPUs and more memory. For more details, see the [AWS EC2 documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) or a [summary page](https://www.ec2instances.info). For the purpose of illustration, a p2.xlarge will suffice (marked in red box of :numref:`fig_p2x`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** you must use a GPU enabled instance with suitable drivers and a version of MXNet that is GPU enabled. Otherwise you will not see any benefit from using GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Choose an instance.](../img/p2x.png)\n",
    ":width:`700px`\n",
    ":label:`fig_p2x`\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have finished the first two of seven steps for launching an EC2 instance, as shown on the top of :numref:`fig_disk`. In this example, we keep the default configurations for the steps \"3. Configure Instance\", \"5. Add Tags\", and \"6. Configure Security Group\". Tap on \"4. Add Storage\" and increase the default hard disk size to 64 GB (marked in red box of :numref:`fig_disk`). Note that CUDA by itself already takes up 4 GB.\n",

    "![Modify instance hard disk size.](../img/disk.png)\n",
    ":width:`700px`\n",
    ":label:`fig_disk`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, go to \"7. Review\" and click \"Launch\" to launch the configured\n",
    "instance. The system will now prompt you to select the key pair used to access\n",
    "the instance. If you do not have a key pair, select \"Create a new key pair\" in\n",
    "the first drop-down menu in :numref:`fig_keypair` to generate a key pair. Subsequently,\n",
    "you can select \"Choose an existing key pair\" for this menu and then select the\n",
    "previously generated key pair. Click \"Launch Instances\" to launch the created\n",
    "instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Select a key pair.](../img/keypair.png)\n",

    "Make sure that you download the key pair and store it in a safe location if you\n",
    "generated a new one. This is your only way to SSH into the server. Click the\n",
    "instance ID shown in :numref:`fig_launching` to view the status of this instance.\n",

    ":label:`fig_launching`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to the Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in :numref:`fig_connect`, after the instance state turns green, right-click the instance and select `Connect` to view the instance access method.\n",

    "![View instance access and startup method.](../img/connect.png)\n",
    ":width:`700px`\n",
    ":label:`fig_connect`\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is a new key, it must not be publicly viewable for SSH to work. Go to the folder where you store `D2L_key.pem` (e.g., the Downloads folder) and make sure that the key is not publicly viewable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd /Downloads  ## if D2L_key.pem is stored in Downloads folder\n",
    "chmod 400 D2L_key.pem\n",

    ":label:`fig_chmod`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, copy the ssh command in the lower red box of :numref:`fig_chmod` and paste onto the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh -i \"D2L_key.pem\" ubuntu@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.y.compute.amazonaws.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the command line prompts \"Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)\", enter \"yes\" and press Enter to log into the instance.\n",

    "## Installing MXNet and Downloading the D2L Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "First, to simplify the installation, you need to install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for Linux. The download link and file name are subject to changes, so please go the Miniconda website and click \"Copy Link Address\" as shown in :numref:`fig_miniconda`.\n",

    "unzip d2l-en.zip && rm d2l-en.zip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then create the conda `d2l` environment and enter `y` to proceed with the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name d2l -y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the `d2l` environment, activate it and install `pip`.\n",

    "## Running Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "To run Jupyter remotely you need to use SSH port forwarding. After all, the server in the cloud does not have a monitor or keyboard. For this, log into your server from your desktop (or laptop) as follows.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since you used port forwarding to port 8889 you will need to replace the port number and use the secret as given by Jupyter when opening the URL in your local browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Closing Unused Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "As cloud services are billed by the time of use, you should close instances that are not being used. Note that there are alternatives: \"stopping\" an instance means that you will be able to start it again. This is akin to switching off the power for your regular server. However, stopped instances will still be billed a small amount for the hard disk space retained. \"Terminate\" deletes all data associated with it. This includes the disk, hence you cannot start it again. Only do this if you know that you will not need it in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use the instance as a template for many more instances,\n",
    "right-click on the example in :numref:`fig_connect` and select \"Image\" $\\rightarrow$\n",
    "\"Create\" to create an image of the instance. Once this is complete, select\n",
    "\"Instance State\" $\\rightarrow$ \"Terminate\" to terminate the instance. The next\n",
    "time you want to use this instance, you can follow the steps for creating and\n",
    "running an EC2 instance described in this section to create an instance based on\n",
    "the saved image. The only difference is that, in \"1. Choose AMI\" shown in\n",
    ":numref:`fig_ubuntu`, you must use the \"My AMIs\" option on the left to select your saved\n",
    "image. The created instance will retain the information stored on the image hard\n",
    "disk. For example, you will not have to reinstall CUDA and other runtime\n",
    "environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can launch and stop instances on demand without having to buy and build your own computer.\n",
    "* You need to install suitable GPU drivers before you can use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The cloud offers convenience, but it does not come cheap. Find out how to launch [spot instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) to see how to reduce prices.\n",
    "1. Experiment with different GPU servers. How fast are they?\n",
    "1. Experiment with multi-GPU servers. How well can you scale things up?\n",
