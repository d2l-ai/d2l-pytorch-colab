    "\n",
    "* Real data often contain a mix of different data types and need to be preprocessed.\n",
    "* Rescaling real-valued data to zero mean and unit variance is a good default. So is replacing missing values with their mean.\n",
    "* Transforming categorical features into indicator features allows us to treat them like one-hot vectors.\n",
    "* We can use $K$-fold cross-validation to select the model and adjust the hyperparameters.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Submit your predictions for this section to Kaggle. How good are your predictions?\n",
    "1. Can you improve your model by minimizing the logarithm of prices directly? What happens if you try to predict the logarithm of the price rather than the price?\n",
    "1. Is it always a good idea to replace missing values by their mean? Hint: can you construct a situation where the values are not missing at random?\n",
    "1. Improve the score on Kaggle by tuning the hyperparameters through $K$-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "1. Improve the score by improving the model (e.g., layers, weight decay, and dropout).\n",
    "1. What happens if we do not standardize the continuous numerical features like what we have done in this section?\n"
