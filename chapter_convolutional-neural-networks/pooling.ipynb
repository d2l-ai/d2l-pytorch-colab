    "Often, as we process images, we want to gradually\n",
    "reduce the spatial resolution of our hidden representations,\n",
    "aggregating information so that\n",
    "the higher up we go in the network,\n",
    "the larger the receptive field (in the input)\n",
    "to which each hidden node is sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often our ultimate task asks some global question about the image,\n",
    "e.g., *does it contain a cat?*\n",
    "So typically the units of our final layer should be sensitive\n",
    "to the entire input.\n",
    "By gradually aggregating information, yielding coarser and coarser maps,\n",
    "we accomplish this goal of ultimately learning a global representation,\n",
    "while keeping all of the advantages of convolutional layers at the intermediate layers of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, when detecting lower-level features, such as edges\n",
    "(as discussed in :numref:`sec_conv_layer`),\n",
    "we often want our representations to be somewhat invariant to translation.\n",
    "For instance, if we take the image `X`\n",
    "with a sharp delineation between black and white\n",
    "and shift the whole image by one pixel to the right,\n",
    "i.e., `Z[i, j] = X[i, j + 1]`,\n",
    "then the output for the new image `Z` might be vastly different.\n",

    "## Maximum Pooling and Average Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Like convolutional layers, *pooling* operators\n",
    "consist of a fixed-shape window that is slid over\n",

    "computing a single output for each location traversed\n",
    "by the fixed-shape window (sometimes known as the *pooling window*).\n",
    "However, unlike the cross-correlation computation\n",
    "of the inputs and kernels in the convolutional layer,\n",
    "the pooling layer contains no parameters (there is no *kernel*).\n",
    "Instead, pooling operators are deterministic,\n",
    "typically calculating either the maximum or the average value\n",
    "of the elements in the pooling window.\n",
    "These operations are called *maximum pooling* (*max pooling* for short)\n",
    "and *average pooling*, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, as with the cross-correlation operator,\n",
    "we can think of the pooling window\n",
    "as starting from the upper-left of the input tensor\n",
    "and sliding across the input tensor from left to right and top to bottom.\n",
    "At each location that the pooling window hits,\n",
    "it computes the maximum or average\n",
    "value of the input subtensor in the window,\n",
    "depending on whether max or average pooling is employed.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Taking the input elements in the pooling window, the maximum pooling operation assigns the maximum value as the output and the average pooling operation assigns the average value as the output.\n",
    "* One of the major benefits of a pooling layer is to alleviate the excessive sensitivity of the convolutional layer to location.\n",
    "* We can specify the padding and stride for the pooling layer.\n",
    "* Maximum pooling, combined with a stride larger than 1 can be used to reduce the spatial dimensions (e.g., width and height).\n",
    "* The pooling layer's number of output channels is the same as the number of input channels.\n",

    "1. Can you implement maximum pooling as a special case of a convolution layer? If so, do it.\n",
    "1. What is the computational cost of the pooling layer? Assume that the input to the pooling layer is of size $c\\times h\\times w$, the pooling window has a shape of $p_h\\times p_w$ with a padding of $(p_h, p_w)$ and a stride of $(s_h, s_w)$.\n",
    "1. Why do you expect maximum pooling and average pooling to work differently?\n",
    "1. Do we need a separate minimum pooling layer? Can you replace it with another operation?\n",
    "1. Is there another operation between average and maximum pooling that you could consider (hint: recall the softmax)? Why might it not be so popular?\n"
