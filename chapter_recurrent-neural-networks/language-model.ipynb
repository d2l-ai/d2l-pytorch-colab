    "Unfortunately, \n",
    "estimating the\n",
    "probability of a word pair is somewhat more difficult, since the\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, models like this get unwieldy rather quickly\n",
    "for the following reasons. \n",
    "First, \n",
    "as discussed in :numref:`subsec_natural-lang-stat`,\n",
    "many $n$-grams occur very rarely, \n",
    "making Laplace smoothing rather unsuitable for language modeling.\n",
    "Second, we need to store all counts.\n",
    "Third, this entirely ignores the meaning of the words. For\n",
    "instance, \"cat\" and \"feline\" should occur in related contexts.\n",
    "It is quite difficult to adjust such models to additional contexts,\n",
    "whereas, deep learning based language models are well suited to\n",
    "take this into account.\n",
    "Last, long word\n",
    "sequences are almost certain to be novel, hence a model that simply\n",
    "counts the frequency of previously seen word sequences is bound to perform poorly there.\n",
    "Therefore, we focus on using neural networks for language modeling\n",
    "in the rest of the chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Perplexity\n",
    ":label:`subsec_perplexity`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's discuss about how to measure the quality of the language model, which we will then use to evaluate our models in the subsequent sections.\n",
    "One way is to check how surprising the text is.\n",
    "A good language model is able to predict, with high accuracy, the tokens that come next.\n",
    "Consider the following continuations of the phrase \"It is raining\", as proposed by different language models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"It is raining outside\"\n",
    "1. \"It is raining banana tree\"\n",
    "1. \"It is raining piouw;kcj pwepoiut\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of quality, Example 1 is clearly the best. The words are sensible and logically coherent.\n",
    "While it might not quite accurately reflect which word follows semantically (\"in San Francisco\" and \"in winter\" would have been perfectly reasonable extensions), the model is able to capture which kind of word follows.\n",
    "Example 2 is considerably worse by producing a nonsensical extension. Nonetheless, at least the model has learned how to spell words and some degree of correlation between words. Last, Example 3 indicates a poorly trained model that does not fit data properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might measure the quality of the model by computing  the likelihood of the sequence.\n",
    "Unfortunately this is a number that is hard to understand and difficult to compare.\n",
    "After all, shorter sequences are much more likely to occur than the longer ones,\n",
    "hence evaluating the model on Tolstoy's magnum opus\n",
    "*War and Peace* will inevitably produce a much smaller likelihood than, say, on Saint-Exupery's novella *The Little Prince*. What is missing is the equivalent of an average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information theory comes handy here.\n",
    "We defined entropy, surprisal, and cross-entropy\n",
    "when we introduced the softmax regression\n",
    "(:numref:`subsec_info_theory_basics`).\n",
    "If we want to compress text, we can ask about\n",
    "predicting the next token given the current set of tokens.\n",
    "A better language model should allow us to predict the next token more accurately.\n",
    "Thus, it should allow us to spend fewer bits in compressing the sequence.\n",
    "So we can measure it by the cross-entropy loss averaged\n",
    "over all the $n$ tokens of a sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t=1}^n -\\log P(x_t \\mid x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_1),$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_avg_ce_for_lm`\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P$ is given by a language model and $x_t$ is the actual token observed at time step $t$ from the sequence.\n",
    "This makes the performance on documents of different lengths comparable. For historical reasons, scientists in natural language processing prefer to use a quantity called *perplexity*. In a nutshell, it is the exponential of :eqref:`eq_avg_ce_for_lm`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t=1}^n \\log P(x_t \\mid x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_1)\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity can be best understood as the reciprocal of the geometric mean of the number of real choices that we have when deciding which token to pick next. Let's look at a number of cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the best case scenario, the model always perfectly estimates the probability of the target token as 1. In this case the perplexity of the model is 1.\n",
    "* In the worst case scenario, the model always predicts the probability of the target token as 0. In this situation, the perplexity is positive infinity.\n",
    "* At the baseline, the model predicts a uniform distribution over all the available tokens of the vocabulary. In this case, the perplexity equals the number of unique tokens of the vocabulary. In fact, if we were to store the sequence without any compression, this would be the best we could do for encoding it. Hence, this provides a nontrivial upper bound that any useful model must beat.\n",

    "\n",
    "Language models estimate the joint probability of a text sequence. For long sequences, $n$-grams provide a convenient model by truncating the dependence. However, there is a lot of structure but not enough frequency to deal efficiently with infrequent word combinations via Laplace smoothing. Thus, we will focus on neural language modeling in subsequent sections.\n",
    "To train language models, we can randomly sample pairs of input sequences and target sequences in minibatches. After training, we will use perplexity to measure the language model quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models can be scaled up with increased data size, model size, and amount in training compute. Large language models can perform desired tasks by predicting output text given input text instructions. As we will discuss later (e.g., :numref:`sec_large-pretraining-transformers`),\n",
    "at the present moment\n",
    "large language models form the basis of state-of-the-art systems across diverse tasks.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suppose there are 100,000 words in the training dataset. How much word frequency and multi-word adjacent frequency does a four-gram need to store?\n",
    "1. How would you model a dialogue?\n",
    "1. What other methods can you think of for reading long sequence data?\n",
    "1. Consider our method for discarding a uniformly random number of the first few tokens at the beginning of each epoch.\n",
    "    1. Does it really lead to a perfectly uniform distribution over the sequences on the document?\n",
    "    1. What would you have to do to make things even more uniform? \n",
    "1. If we want a sequence example to be a complete sentence, what kind of problem does this introduce in minibatch sampling? How can we fix it?\n"
